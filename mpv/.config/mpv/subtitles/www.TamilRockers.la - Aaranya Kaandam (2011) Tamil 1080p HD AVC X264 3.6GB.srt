00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:52,227
400 BC
NagaDutta : Vishnugupta, what is dharma?

2
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:56,050
Vishnugupta Chankya : Dharma is doing what is necessary

3
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:58,630
Today

4
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:12,497
Yo Chittu, you continue..

5
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,281
Chittu: It's a simple matter

6
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,955
Say you are in a train..

7
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:20,474
And you see a nice lady with a kid

8
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:23,717
You start the conversation by playing with the kid

9
00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:26,908
Where ever you start, it's always gonna end in 2 topics

10
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:29,662
Politics and cinema

11
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:34,257
You start with "What is the last film you saw?"

12
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:37,430
Now, you ask the most important question

13
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,474
'You like Rajinikant  or Kamal Hasan?'

14
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,518
Machi, that's the main matter.

15
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:45,872
That's how I had gotten haid with many ladies...

16
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:48,052
If they like Rajini, let them be

17
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,091
But if the like Kamal...then she is a horny one.. an easy lay!

18
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:53,330
We can easily work those flirts

19
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:54,594
Why is that?

20
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:55,945
Kamal looks sexy to them

21
00:04:56,118 --> 00:04:58,224
Simple technique.. works with unknown woman.
Make her cry somehow....

22
00:04:58,302 --> 00:04:59,402
Console her ...  screw her!

23
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:00,587
Hey Sappa ( looser) !

24
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:02,911
Looser.. why are you so Sappa (Looser) ?

25
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:04,612
Have you done anything in life?

26
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:07,735
Look at our Ayya!

27
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:11,581
Even at his age, he keeps up with an young girl

28
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:15,254
The old man doesn't trust us with her

29
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:16,695
But he trusts you

30
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,174
Why?

31
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:19,975
Because you are a sappa (Looser)

32
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:24,745
Pasupathy: Hey Sappa, go buy me a tea

33
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:26,316
I bought it already

34
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:29,421
OK, buy one more

35
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:31,918
Hey

36
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:33,969
You stay here

37
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,373
A mule has come from Rameswaram

38
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,303
- What is it?

39
00:06:13,015 --> 00:06:14,505
Powdered cocaine

40
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,113
Market rate is ₹20,000,000

41
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:19,561
He is willing to sell for ₹5,000,000

42
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:28,172
- Why?

43
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:30,869
- His sister loves me?

44
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:34,318
It's not his

45
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:36,857
He is just a mule

46
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:40,032
He is not happy with his cut

47
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:43,107
So he want to sell it for ₹5,000,000 and settle in life

48
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:44,411
- Whose is it?

49
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:46,407
Gajendran's

50
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:50,091
- He will fuck our shit out

51
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:51,139
Let him

52
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:52,247
Hey Pashupati !

53
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:54,849
Hey, he will try..

54
00:06:55,055 --> 00:06:56,614
But we are also not gonna be quiet

55
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:58,859
We can manage

56
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,692
If the stuff is in our hands

57
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:04,705
.. then we can control the business for some time

58
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:08,622
We can go back to what we were...

59
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:11,314
Risky

60
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,220
Its a .... good deal

61
00:07:19,162 --> 00:07:20,006
Hah !

62
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,457
Why? Are you a limp dick now?

63
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:27,693
Grandpa has gone limp

64
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,277
Can I speak my mind?

65
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,482
Lend me ₹5,000,000, I will take care of the business

66
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:38,698
The risk is all mine.

67
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:41,670
Now on, I will take over such risky businesses

68
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:45,196
We will split the profits 50-50

69
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,767
What do you think?

70
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:16,683
We do the deal tomorrow...

71
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,548
(yes)

72
00:08:20,494 --> 00:08:21,255
Hey..

73
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,400
- call the Marwari Seth

74
00:08:25,883 --> 00:08:27,667
- He will give a 'five millions'

75
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:29,503
- Go fetch it

76
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:38,257
- You first check the stuff

77
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:43,239
- We will think about percentage later

78
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:50,212
- Pasupathy

79
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:46,255
Go

80
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:53,361
- I am no limp dick

81
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,388
- Still got it

82
00:08:57,966 --> 00:08:59,076
Go

83
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:09,340
Mayilvaganam Sir, we are here

84
00:10:11,668 --> 00:10:14,486
Who's doing this business? Ayya or you?

85
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,618
No clue..... That is Ayya's style

86
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:22,069
Chittu: You kept running your mouth

87
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:24,185
We shit our pants, didn't know what to do there

88
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:26,296
'you didn't know what to do'?

89
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:28,032
Do as Ayya tells you to!

90
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,374
You do work for him..

91
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:32,696
Bark if you dress up as a dog

92
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:37,060
(on phone)Yeah, tell me Kasthuri!

93
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:39,156
I am coming

94
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,187
I am on a job

95
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:52,036
Pasupathy, what's with all the crowd?

96
00:10:53,312 --> 00:11:02,795
♪ (Ponmeni uruguthey from Moondram Pirai)♪

97
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,909
Isn't it a good song?

98
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:08,278
I love this vamp (Actress Silk Smitha) with a golden heart !

99
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:10,537
Poor girl! Untimely death. Why did she hang her ?

100
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:13,719
(Pasupathy) Sir, where is the stuff?

101
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:22,530
They told me that cocaine has arrived. The place...It's some name....

102
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:25,560
...It's in the tip of my tongue. But it's not coming out of me yet....

103
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:26,803
Do you know why?

104
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:42,237
Bava lodge

105
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:44,841
Are you gonna snatch it?

106
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,262
Don't know

107
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:51,876
Sir, can you keep this quiet?

108
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,792
Don't know

109
00:11:56,888 --> 00:11:58,865
Chittu: Pasupathy, I thought he was Gajendran's man?

110
00:11:58,922 --> 00:12:00,708
Hay ! You think he is a thug?

111
00:12:01,478 --> 00:12:03,318
He is a police sub-inspector

112
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:05,440
If there is money, he will work for anyone

113
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:07,334
What is he saying about me?

114
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:09,789
Nothing bad, you carry on boss

115
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:15,552
Do you realize whose stuff it is?

116
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:18,549
Sir, A good drink is never without a stink.

117
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:19,410
hay

118
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,927
You know about Gajendran, don't you?

119
00:12:22,146 --> 00:12:24,408
He is a Son of Bitch. Better watch your ass.

120
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:29,101
Gagendra Gajendra..What's all this fuss about Gajendran?

121
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,509
Master, 5 teas!

122
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:33,564
Let me tell you a story

123
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:35,621
15 years back..

124
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:40,252
Gajendran and Gajapathy were peaking in their import/export business

125
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,357
There was this guy, related to them....

126
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:44,678
Brother-in-law?

127
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:45,991
A distant brother-in-law

128
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:48,314
He was working as a mule for them

129
00:12:48,553 --> 00:12:49,794
In a deal...

130
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:53,485
...instead of 10 pieces only 8 showed up

131
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,437
Gajendran had a big doubt on the mule

132
00:12:58,162 --> 00:12:59,694
He brought mule's whole family...

133
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:01,827
- ... and kicked the piss out
- His own brother-in-law?

134
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,835
ha, that's mean shit

135
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:05,801
Right in front his family...

136
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:08,560
... broke his fucking face

137
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,848
Then he poured boiling oil on him..

138
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:12,723
...the skin started peeling off

139
00:13:12,784 --> 00:13:14,532
His kids are crying out loud now

140
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,569
His wife is hysterical

141
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,874
After all that, he still sticks to his story

142
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:22,749
Now comes the plot twist

143
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,758
A call comes in..

144
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:26,094
...for Gajendran

145
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,861
'Boss, the stuff is all alright'

146
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,942
'It was a packing mistake..'

147
00:13:32,863 --> 00:13:34,399
'The Mule's hands are clean'

148
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:35,426
...and the call ended.

149
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:38,218
The beaten up mule is now staring at Gajendran

150
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:40,571
Gajendran slowly took out a knife out of his pocket..

151
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:42,427
...and sliced open mule's throat

152
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:45,151
The blood gushed out like flush water

153
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:47,106
Mule was dead

154
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:49,120
Why he did that?

155
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:52,321
'After all this torture today...'

156
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,495
'...if he gets a chance tomorrow...'

157
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,773
'...and the knife turns around...'

158
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:58,286
'..that's why!'

159
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,574
Now brother Gajapathy goes to the wife...

160
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:02,964
'It was a unknowing mistake..'

161
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,685
'.. was just a business misunderstanding'

162
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:07,832
'So, don't bring it up ever'

163
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,142
He even apologized to her

164
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,330
Now Gajendran walks to the wife ...

165
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,507
...takes her hand like he is consoling her..

166
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:19,118
..and says 'Don't let anyone know'...

167
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:21,216
..takes her hand to his mouth..

168
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:23,935
...and bites the fucking thumb off her hand.

169
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:27,097
'She agreed not to say a word'

170
00:14:27,377 --> 00:14:29,333
'Then, why did you bite the finger?'

171
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:30,474
... asks Gajapathy

172
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:35,209
'After she speaks, it's no use in chopping fingers '

173
00:14:36,637 --> 00:14:38,042
That's Gajendran

174
00:14:38,955 --> 00:14:41,501
The girl never came back in town after

175
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:55,316
Just with his teeth?

176
00:14:55,821 --> 00:14:59,215
I have heard a story about a vanishing ghost hitchhiker

177
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:01,482
Ask if they have seen it, they will reply 'no'

178
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,705
But his acquaintance's acquaintance had seen it

179
00:15:04,308 --> 00:15:06,572
This is just a built up legend

180
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:08,647
...and you fell for it

181
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:10,052
You only look smart..

182
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,336
..but you are dumb ass

183
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:29,700
Bava Lodge

184
00:15:30,706 --> 00:15:33,022
Mule: That's all Kalaiya. I bring the goods

185
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,257
Deliver and get ₹10,000 for that

186
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:36,868
After that, for 2 months..

187
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:38,489
..drinks and cuties

188
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:41,180
Bring the goods again

189
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:42,245
Deliver

190
00:15:42,284 --> 00:15:43,681
Drinks and cuties

191
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:47,940
You can't believe me?

192
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,107
See this

193
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:53,193
(Kalaiyan) The cutie is not that cute

194
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:56,044
...but she still makes me jealous of you... you are my hero.

195
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:57,004
No! I am afraid

196
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,755
If you get caught, you are a jelly....gone

197
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:02,034
So, I have decided..

198
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:03,786
I am not giving it this time

199
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,599
Instead

200
00:16:05,984 --> 00:16:08,722
I am giving it to these guys

201
00:16:10,314 --> 00:16:12,794
They have tricked by throwing just 10,000 at me

202
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:15,035
I didn't know about it's worth

203
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:18,869
Or How much you get here?

204
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,152
15,000?

205
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:24,288
20,000?

206
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:27,674
That much?

207
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:36,096
What is in here?

208
00:16:36,355 --> 00:16:37,865
Like X-ray goggles?

209
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:41,362
Can we see everything through the clothes?

210
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,335
hmm, you will see nothing

211
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:45,073
All lights are out

212
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,306
You will feel nothing

213
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:55,180
It's white man's snuff - heavy

214
00:16:56,385 --> 00:16:58,011
I am settled for life with this

215
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,756
WoW! A drink to that, lets celebrate...

216
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,794
One for me?   oh this is mine

217
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:18,063
(Kodukkapuli) Haven't moved it's lazy ass...Chi !

218
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,036
Hey Kalaiya

219
00:17:21,145 --> 00:17:22,829
Why is Kodukkapuli pissed?

220
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:25,039
Is he yelling at the cock or me?

221
00:17:25,184 --> 00:17:27,029
I have the same question

222
00:17:27,322 --> 00:17:28,526
Hey Kodukkapuli

223
00:17:28,574 --> 00:17:30,200
Feed the cock it will be hungry now

224
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:31,824
Mind your fucking business

225
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:33,777
He is a funny talker

226
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:35,481
Funny talker

227
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:38,019
A kid is cursing at you, do you have no shame?

228
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,697
What's the shame in it?

229
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:42,248
He is my son.. my own blood

230
00:17:42,814 --> 00:17:44,471
My son Kodukkapuli...

231
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:47,167
Curse a few swear words at your dad

232
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,476
He won't curse now, that's the technique

233
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:58,674
He is just like his mom

234
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:00,246
Fair skinned , wavy hair...

235
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:02,031
.. and a proud person

236
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:03,849
I gambled away all my fortunes..

237
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:06,047
.. that's why he is angry

238
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:10,232
Aaaaa !

239
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:12,974
No, I may not look that way

240
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,129
I am from a Zamindar(aristocrat) family

241
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:18,598
Someone just bought my palace to make it a hotel

242
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:21,116
Idiots

243
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,780
I lost everything

244
00:18:22,824 --> 00:18:24,766
At last, I opened a small store

245
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:27,616
I gave away the goods on credit

246
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:29,204
When I went asking for money..

247
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:32,194
They replied, 'How can an aristocrat ask money?'

248
00:18:32,294 --> 00:18:33,966
I couldn't insist on returning the money...

249
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:35,231
....from those poor peasants

250
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,673
But I couldn't leave it at that

251
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:40,990
Then, I borrowed ₹2,000 to buy more goods...

252
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:43,239
.. but it was some kind of rocket interest loan

253
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:46,146
The lender is now asking for ₹5,000 to payoff

254
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:47,375
Now, threatening too

255
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:49,231
Where do I go for that much money?

256
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:51,450
That's why, we brought the cock here

257
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,482
Now, after Kaattu Munieswaran, he is our family deity

258
00:18:54,557 --> 00:18:56,613
This Kaalayan's last treasure

259
00:18:56,672 --> 00:19:01,786
After he wins today, I am going to settle all debts

260
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,183
... and save my family

261
00:19:03,502 --> 00:19:05,193
Come here my golden goose

262
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:07,374
(Kudukkapulli) Chi, Don't touch my rooster.

263
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:11,475
It's actually his rooster

264
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:13,396
To me, he is my son.

265
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:15,202
For him, the rooster is his son

266
00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:17,585
If it were mine, I would have sold and gotten drunk

267
00:19:17,931 --> 00:19:20,560
Kaalaya, whom did you borrow the money from?

268
00:19:20,923 --> 00:19:22,349
From Varaagamoorthy

269
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:24,601
That asshole?

270
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:26,618
If he doesn't get back the money...

271
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:28,457
... he sells their wives and kids for prostitution

272
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:29,263
Aai !

273
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:32,332
So, it is for real?.. it is for real?

274
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:34,011
Does it really happen?

275
00:19:34,545 --> 00:19:36,693
I didn't listen to anyone's advice back home

276
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:39,482
You came from nowhere and you know what he does

277
00:19:39,982 --> 00:19:41,049
I had no clue

278
00:19:41,826 --> 00:19:43,457
Everything is lost

279
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:45,132
Drink up, all will be well

280
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:46,771
Drink, don't worry

281
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:48,980
You don't think it will happen?

282
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:50,249
Don't worry

283
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:51,904
You! who talks like that?

284
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:54,147
Act like a grown man

285
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,263
OK, stop drinking. Listen to the grown up there.. you moron

286
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:57,575
Your son is angry

287
00:19:57,982 --> 00:19:59,240
He is annoyd

288
00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:04,461
I am proud

289
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:07,919
I have a room

290
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:09,301
I am leaving

291
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:11,937
Kodukkapuli, I will see you later

292
00:20:12,557 --> 00:20:14,418
Bye Kaalaya

293
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:23,591
So wasted ..... so wasted ..... so wasted

294
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:44,061
Get up ... quick

295
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:46,870
Fighting is unethical..

296
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,863
Getting late for the fight

297
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:40,623
Pa ! Wake up!

298
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:49,449
Shut up and move....

299
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,917
Lift your hand. The other one

300
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,794
Turn around

301
00:21:29,008 --> 00:21:31,063
Say Aaaa

302
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:11,613
- Please take him to his room
- OK

303
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:17,490
- Please go
- OK

304
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:37,734
Vanakkam Ayya

305
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:40,083
Ayya, there's 5 in here

306
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:55,051
♪ (RJ talking on radio) ♪

307
00:23:10,675 --> 00:23:32,257
♪ (Oru naalukkul ethanai kanavu) ♪

308
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:43,821
Hey Sappa! (Looser)

309
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:51,281
The dumb whore Subbu is crying upstairs

310
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:53,497
Buy whatever she needs

311
00:23:54,152 --> 00:23:56,010
Take her wherever she asks you to

312
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,727
Keep this money

313
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:02,285
Ask her not to cry

314
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:05,582
A look on her face, and I go limp...

315
00:24:23,037 --> 00:24:32,645
(TV playing)

316
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,871
(Disney Channel playing 'Power Rangers')

317
00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:27,919
Hey Subbu! look here.. Magic Magic...

318
00:25:48,723 --> 00:25:52,915
Don't feel bad that he hit you. He is a good man

319
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,162
A good man?

320
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:58,279
I am young enough to be his grand kid

321
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,345
He tricked me to be his mistress

322
00:26:00,723 --> 00:26:02,966
And you call him good man?

323
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,817
Earlier he couldn't do it..

324
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:10,810
....to hide that he beat me

325
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:13,345
And you call him good?

326
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:15,115
You were upset...

327
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:16,628
..was trying to console you

328
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,368
Subbu: Piss off fool........

329
00:26:18,504 --> 00:26:19,371
Sorry

330
00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:23,312
That's why I am 'Sappa' (fool) and no one likes me

331
00:26:23,926 --> 00:26:25,922
But I really like you

332
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:28,046
Why?

333
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:30,306
Because you are like me...

334
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:37,937
Don't cry...........don't cry........don't cry

335
00:27:23,397 --> 00:27:26,478
- You need some talent for that
- (on phone) I am in Madras now

336
00:27:26,642 --> 00:27:28,567
If I walk on the streets...

337
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,170
I can get both the girl and her mom

338
00:27:31,374 --> 00:27:33,390
(on phone) Don't fuss. I will come home for dinner.

339
00:27:34,461 --> 00:27:36,328
I will come home at night

340
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,097
Let me tell you something

341
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:39,671
I have seduced many ladies

342
00:27:40,145 --> 00:27:43,216
But there is one, I want to screw really...

343
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,512
... our Subbu

344
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,575
(on phone) Hey wear that red sari

345
00:27:53,153 --> 00:27:54,772
Why are you looking at me like that?

346
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,308
Don't you have that idea?

347
00:27:56,403 --> 00:27:58,170
Will you kick her off the bed?

348
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:00,067
Well, he is a loyal husband.

349
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:02,107
You don't wish that?

350
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:04,645
Everyone staring as if I am a pervert.

351
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:07,343
She is a poor girl!

352
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,455
I am also thinking about her with love and affection.

353
00:28:09,602 --> 00:28:11,019
I do really like her

354
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,564
Ayya tricked her by promising she will be a movie star

355
00:28:14,588 --> 00:28:16,752
I have liked her since then

356
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,677
Hey ! Pardon me you high Sirs.

357
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,374
(on phone) OK stop talking and cut the phone

358
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:29,235
Anna(bro), is it new girl friend?

359
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:30,439
No, boy friend .... dick head

360
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:31,778
oh, he is pissed.

361
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:33,013
Let me see your phone

362
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,329
What is this shit phone- fossils ..?

363
00:28:36,346 --> 00:28:37,900
There are way better phones now

364
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,982
Colour phone, video phone speaker phone,...

365
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:41,341
Why do you have it?

366
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:43,107
- Why do I need that?
- Why?

In a video phone, you can watch actress showering

368
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:50,271
What can you see in that tiny screen? Give it back

369
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:57,071
Ok, atleast a color or speaker phone is bare necessacity?

370
00:28:57,215 --> 00:28:59,083
Why do you need a speaker? Are you deaf?

371
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:00,708
Enlighten him!

372
00:29:02,484 --> 00:29:03,650
Look at our Chittu

373
00:29:04,253 --> 00:29:08,099
When ladies speak to him, we listen to it on speaker

374
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,693
Some say- You are super....

375
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:15,396
'You are the best, my husband is nothing'....

376
00:29:15,883 --> 00:29:18,054
Don't they know it's on speaker?

377
00:29:18,737 --> 00:29:19,964
The ones falling for him?

378
00:29:20,787 --> 00:29:22,575
They all have to be dumb

379
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:24,370
Don't talk bad about them, Pasupathy

380
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:26,901
It's not about being dumb or sharp. It's technology

381
00:29:26,968 --> 00:29:28,626
Let me put this call on speaker..

382
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,940
If they don't find it out...

383
00:29:31,043 --> 00:29:32,652
You have insulted me and my herem..

384
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,278
... you are buying beer for all of us

385
00:29:35,142 --> 00:29:37,021
Why beer for everyone?

386
00:29:37,114 --> 00:29:40,091
You insulted me before them, so you should.....

387
00:29:41,449 --> 00:29:43,115
Sir, Sir, please get the phone

388
00:29:43,355 --> 00:29:45,740
They wouldn't mind, lets bet on it

389
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:47,943
Ok

390
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,225

393
00:29:57,121 --> 00:29:58,271
No, I am not

394

396
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:07,577
Where are the goods?

400
00:30:15,543 --> 00:30:20,208
OK, kill Pasupathy before the checkpost

401
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:40,856
Aren't we all friends?

402
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:43,272
Then, why the cunt-hair you tooled up?

So, Rajini?

496
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:54,981
- Why?
- Because he is Rajini

497
00:40:55,177 --> 00:40:57,193
- Which is your favorite movie?
- Baashha

After we won, what's the need for that victory song?

510
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:11,851
He killed him, because he was pissed at you

511
00:43:11,953 --> 00:43:16,083
I swear on you, I did nothing. You saw it didn't you?

00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,228
No, he is sleeping

535
00:46:51,564 --> 00:46:53,410
He is not breathing. He is dead.

536
00:46:53,585 --> 00:46:59,116
- You stealer, you must have killed him!
- I didn't. He kept on drinking with you, you killed him!

537
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,855

00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:29,939
In our village....

00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,477
...when our lost cow, came back what did gradma say?

545
00:47:34,087 --> 00:47:36,883
'Our god Kattumuni brought it back'

546
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:38,753
This is given to us by Kattumuni

547
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:40,646
He couldn't bear our suffering...

548
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,707
... he came through someone's body...

549
00:47:42,755 --> 00:47:47,138
gave the goods...the details...and left

550
00:47:48,438 --> 00:47:50,784
Have we seen this guy before?

551
00:47:50,949 --> 00:47:53,590
Then why did he show up and give us this?

552
00:47:57,454 --> 00:48:00,603
You still don't believe it? See what we have offered

553
00:48:06,714 --> 00:48:09,244
Oh, that is Kattumuni

554
00:48:10,411 --> 00:48:13,099
Lets go, religious rioter!

555
00:48:45,943 --> 00:48:47,935
Why are you in a hurry?

556
00:48:48,045 --> 00:48:48,623
Nah..

557
00:48:48,879 --> 00:48:50,433
God is with us

558
00:48:51,138 --> 00:48:56,140
From today, all debts are gone. Worries gone.

559
00:48:56,357 --> 00:49:01,303
Ache gone. Agony gone. Misery gone.

560
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,936
Go..Go...Go..

561
00:50:34,571 --> 00:50:35,932
Brother, it's not here.

562
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:37,814
Go check again

563
00:50:37,818 --> 00:50:39,226
I searched well

564
00:50:39,467 --> 00:50:43,146
The deal we heard about with Pasupathy, must be true

565
00:50:47,231 --> 00:50:51,612
If you were alive now.... I would have killed you

566
00:51:51,184 --> 00:51:52,046
Hello

567
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:52,828
Hello

568
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:54,070
Hello

569
00:51:54,331 --> 00:51:56,240
What the fuck ? Fucker not talking.. fucking fuck?

570
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:57,302
Hello hello

571
00:51:57,385 --> 00:51:58,791
It has been a long time

572
00:51:59,482 --> 00:52:01,431
Singapermal! Why did you steal my drugs?

573
00:52:01,797 --> 00:52:03,894
Whose drugs are those?

574
00:52:04,897 --> 00:52:06,346
Reply

575
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,052
It's mine

576
00:52:08,072 --> 00:52:09,733
Whose mule brought it?

577
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:11,005
He is mine too

578
00:52:11,074 --> 00:52:12,759
But I heard Pasupathy is going to steal it

579
00:52:13,607 --> 00:52:15,217
I will not take it..

580
00:52:17,037 --> 00:52:18,123
Got it ?

581
00:52:18,466 --> 00:52:19,763
Pasupathi took it ?

582
00:52:20,248 --> 00:52:21,326
Correct..

583
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,294
Is it Pashupathy's number ?

584
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:24,810
No

585
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:27,373
Sorry wrong number

586
00:52:28,972 --> 00:52:30,589
Motherfucker

587
00:52:41,574 --> 00:52:43,115
Told you

588
00:52:43,867 --> 00:52:45,818
Gajapathy: Hey! Do you think I am a dumb fuck

589
00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:47,470
- who will suck my own dick ?

590
00:52:47,537 --> 00:52:49,318
I will kill you all ... you don't know me

591
00:52:49,394 --> 00:52:50,168
Hey Gajapathi.

592
00:52:50,365 --> 00:52:53,709
Do you know its value ? Fuckers I will massacre you all..

593
00:52:54,057 --> 00:52:55,897
Everyone knows about your brother Gajendran's reputation

594
00:52:55,944 --> 00:52:58,029
Doesn't make a fucking difference if he took or you did

595
00:52:58,052 --> 00:52:59,669
I did'nt take it..

596
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,260
Pasupathi took it..

597
00:53:03,434 --> 00:53:07,839
Hey! you fucking with me? How does it matter who took it?
He is your guy..

598
00:53:08,434 --> 00:53:10,515
Was my man.....Not anymore..

599
00:53:10,826 --> 00:53:13,209
Ok Ok .. I will kill him

600
00:53:13,742 --> 00:53:15,685
Go ahead.. be a man..

601
00:53:16,951 --> 00:53:18,896
I will buy you a lolipop.

602
00:53:21,172 --> 00:53:24,685
Hey ! This is Mullu's area, right? Ask him to kill Pasupathi.

603
00:53:24,722 --> 00:53:25,943
He has got the cocaine.

604
00:53:26,145 --> 00:53:28,205
Then let him grab the cocaine before killing him.

605
00:53:28,376 --> 00:53:29,807
But Mullu is not reliable..

606
00:53:29,904 --> 00:53:31,732
I know. Just get the Pasupathi killed. Go

607
00:53:34,896 --> 00:53:40,888
Singapermal ! If the two of you are conning me,
or even if I get a doubt that you are, I will fuck you all..

608
00:53:41,675 --> 00:53:44,536
Hey Gajapathi ! you know about me..

609
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:46,411
Trust me...

610
00:53:47,384 --> 00:53:52,614
If not,  then come over... we will sort it out like man

611
00:53:56,963 --> 00:53:59,075
Gajendra does'nt have the stuff...

612
00:53:59,981 --> 00:54:02,232
Nor does Pasupathi..

613
00:54:05,365 --> 00:54:08,115
Ask our men to search the lodge...

614
00:54:08,732 --> 00:54:09,482
Sir..

615
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,773
It should be at the lodge... bring it to me

616
00:54:15,215 --> 00:54:20,450
By then, Gajendran would have killed Pasupathy

617
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:24,068
Killing 3 birds with one stone

618
00:54:26,653 --> 00:54:29,255
Drugs in our hands... one bird

619
00:54:29,716 --> 00:54:30,419
Yes

620
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:34,285
Gajendran killing Pasupathy... second bird............Hun

621
00:54:34,699 --> 00:54:36,091
What's the third bird?

622
00:54:37,068 --> 00:54:38,812
That is You dumb ass

623
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:41,661
Go.. Do your work...

624
00:54:49,069 --> 00:54:50,310
Did you see?

625
00:54:50,338 --> 00:54:53,911
Your buddies came and picked her up

626
00:54:54,399 --> 00:54:55,169
When?

627
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:56,630
It has been a while

628
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:06,833
Son of a whore!

629
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,286
what's with the swearing?

630
00:55:09,603 --> 00:55:11,646
I genuinely asked something...

631
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:13,818
...first you tried to kill me

632
00:55:14,529 --> 00:55:16,262
Now, you have taken Kasthuri

633
00:55:17,576 --> 00:55:19,472
You shouldn't have done that... Singaperumal

634
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:21,273
Eat all you can ..

635
00:55:21,412 --> 00:55:22,709
..drink..

636
00:55:22,742 --> 00:55:26,083
Motherfucker.... your mom's... this is your last day

637
00:55:26,495 --> 00:55:28,581
...firstly, try to save your own ass

638
00:55:29,184 --> 00:55:30,878
You are fucked up !

639
00:55:37,342 --> 00:55:38,620
Mullu

640
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:39,650
Where's the stuff?

641
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:41,435
Hey ! I am dealing with a different problem

642
00:55:41,447 --> 00:55:42,513
Where's the stuff?

643
00:55:42,637 --> 00:55:43,841
Hey ! I don't know

644
00:55:44,252 --> 00:55:47,637
- I am talking here... why did you do that?
- He doesn't understand reason... kill him

645
00:55:47,666 --> 00:55:50,419
- Don't give me orders, do as I say
- Just give me a spanner...

646
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:10,779
Kasthuri is in danger..

647
00:56:18,904 --> 00:56:22,596
Singaperumal is trying to kill me

648
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:31,693
Gajendran's men are chasing to get me

649
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:40,597
Gajendran is pissed off.....

650
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:47,307
Tension... tension... tension...

651
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:51,700
Relax Bachhaaaaaaa !!!!!

652
00:56:56,933 --> 00:56:59,035
Buddha had Bodhi tree...

653
00:56:59,096 --> 00:57:01,169
To a gangster... it's the chase..........Nirvana!

654
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,169
The fear of being killed by whom and when is no more

655
00:57:04,405 --> 00:57:06,097
Because, he is going to kill...

656
00:57:06,105 --> 00:57:07,958
... and he is killing me now....

657
00:57:08,448 --> 00:57:09,874
NOW

658
00:57:10,359 --> 00:57:11,992
Now, I am not running alone

659
00:57:12,205 --> 00:57:14,383
...my death is running along

660
00:57:14,647 --> 00:57:17,520
After meeting death face to face..

661
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:19,311
..I have no confusion

662
00:57:19,381 --> 00:57:20,263
Fuck...

663
00:57:20,548 --> 00:57:22,829
My mind is all clear

664
00:57:51,976 --> 00:57:54,686
If they took Kasthuri, to make me go there....

665
00:57:56,386 --> 00:57:59,338
... she will be alive till I get there.

666
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:03,794
For now, Kasthuri is safe

667
00:58:07,206 --> 00:58:09,521
Till they get the drugs, they won't kill me

668
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:12,266
.... till then I am safe as well

669
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,821
Next problem - Singaperumal

670
00:58:15,888 --> 00:58:17,350
He is a heavy weight

671
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:20,388
I can't do anything alone

672
00:58:22,037 --> 00:58:24,263
Enemy's enemy is a friend

673
00:58:24,655 --> 00:58:26,286
Ayya taught me that

674
00:58:28,058 --> 00:58:30,268
Gajendran is Ayya's enemy

675
00:58:30,323 --> 00:58:31,887
He is a heavy weight too

676
00:58:32,252 --> 00:58:34,345
But his son-of-the-whore are chasing me

What does an enemy become?

680
00:58:52,834 --> 00:58:54,903
Shoot me or leave me

681
00:59:38,455 --> 00:59:42,176
Ae..Why did you buy me a samosa?

682
00:59:42,443 --> 00:59:43,021

We don't have to go that far..lets go to Bombay

692
01:00:51,772 --> 01:00:52,794
Oh yeah.

Dawood Bhai is the big shot there

695
01:01:06,727 --> 01:01:09,302

Also a car... a red one

698
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,118
But I will drive

699
01:01:15,325 --> 01:01:17,313
Subbu, can you drive a car ?

700
01:01:17,998 --> 01:01:19,107
No

703
01:01:27,965 --> 01:01:30,132
...we got none

704
01:01:33,527 --> 01:01:35,947
I will become a day laborer to make a living

705
01:01:35,986 --> 01:01:37,075
No need. we will survive

706
01:01:37,113 --> 01:01:39,911
No. If we go Bombay, we should be rich and live in luxury...

707
01:01:40,835 --> 01:01:43,552
May be I will become a Hindi cinema heroine...

708

Hey ! I know. You are jealous now?

711
01:01:50,737 --> 01:01:53,349
You don't want any other men to touch me

712
01:01:53,439 --> 01:01:57,714

01:02:01,891 --> 01:02:03,831
It will be good to have money..

715
01:02:03,924 --> 01:02:06,982
Where do we go for money, if not for stealing?

716
01:02:07,463 --> 01:02:10,443
Hey ! Don't tell me that we will steal!

717
01:02:10,694 --> 01:02:13,708
We shouldn't take money away from those in need

718
01:02:16,761 --> 01:02:19,781
But..... if we steal like the movie 'Gentleman'?

719
01:02:20,078 --> 01:02:21,929
And rob the wicked?

720
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,245
The only evil rich man we know is Ayya

721
01:02:25,548 --> 01:02:28,681

01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:16,651
I am the only one who drank with our family deity

727
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:19,244
If I say this... no one will believe it

728
01:03:19,298 --> 01:03:22,184
Don't say shit, everyone will laugh out of their asses

729
01:03:25,779 --> 01:03:28,175
Right! You are right

730
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:30,153
The whole world is like this..

731
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,423
...always laughing at the poor

732
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,572
Lets say there is a rich man...

733
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:37,118
He gets off a luxury car

734
01:03:37,316 --> 01:03:39,002
His dhoti slips off....

735
01:03:39,226 --> 01:03:41,193
What will people say?

736
01:03:41,413 --> 01:03:45,529
'Oh no... the good man's dhoti has fallen down'

737
01:03:45,977 --> 01:03:48,575
But if dhoti slips for people like us...

738
01:03:48,754 --> 01:03:52,209
they will say 'Motherfucker, he can't even tie a dhoti'

739
01:03:53,632 --> 01:03:55,719
Money is very important, Kodukkapuli

740
01:03:55,751 --> 01:03:58,209
Then, why the fuck did you gamble it away?

741
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,692
I was deceived

742
01:04:00,872 --> 01:04:03,763
Everyone tricked me

743
01:04:03,894 --> 01:04:05,496
yeah, you are always like this

744
01:04:05,518 --> 01:04:06,860
Not any more

745
01:04:07,314 --> 01:04:10,044
We can earn back all that money in one phone call

746
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,994
Isn't it? What is it?

747
01:04:13,244 --> 01:04:16,212
- Phone number is in the room dumbass
- Stop, I am coming too

748
01:04:46,888 --> 01:04:48,224
Where is it dad?

749
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:50,747
We were talking right here

750
01:04:51,243 --> 01:04:53,833
He also spoke about his 'cutie', remember?

751
01:04:53,896 --> 01:04:55,654
Is it not here? did we lose it?

752
01:04:55,723 --> 01:04:58,284
All is lost!

753
01:04:58,364 --> 01:05:00,902
I knew it! Luck and us?

754
01:05:01,113 --> 01:05:01,865
- Kodukkapuli

755
01:05:01,954 --> 01:05:03,054
- Search you ass

756
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,520
Why?

757
01:05:04,778 --> 01:05:07,140
One can oil the body and roll on the sand

758
01:05:07,225 --> 01:05:08,763
...and you get only sand in return

759
01:05:08,806 --> 01:05:10,818
The astrologer was right back then...

760
01:05:10,967 --> 01:05:13,747
..'you will lose everything you have'

761
01:05:13,873 --> 01:05:17,302
..'you won't get anything ... not a penney either'

762
01:05:17,403 --> 01:05:18,551
Shut your hole and search

763
01:05:18,568 --> 01:05:20,732
Hey ! I shouldn't tell you this

764
01:05:20,994 --> 01:05:23,099
So many women lined up to marry me

765
01:05:23,177 --> 01:05:25,888
Instead, I married your mom, why?

766
01:05:26,492 --> 01:05:27,980
Fate

767
01:05:28,028 --> 01:05:29,536
Nothing good ever
happens to me.

768
01:05:29,617 --> 01:05:30,375
hey, move

769
01:05:31,706 --> 01:05:33,833
It won't happen. I am a loser.

770
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:35,585
Is this it?

771
01:05:37,789 --> 01:05:39,305
We found it?

772
01:05:39,781 --> 01:05:42,161
I knew it. I knew it

773
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:48,209
You can get a thing, only if you keep repeating that you won't

774
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:59,068
Hello!   Is it him?  They were searching for you

775
01:05:59,431 --> 01:06:02,450
It's you? Where is the powder?

776
01:06:50,691 --> 01:06:53,052
Fucking whore! I don't like this town.

777
01:06:53,617 --> 01:06:55,195
In morning, they killed the cock

778
01:06:55,201 --> 01:06:57,070
Now, they are trying to kill us

779
01:06:57,149 --> 01:06:59,215
No respect for aristocrats here

780
01:07:03,888 --> 01:07:05,310
How much to ask?

781
01:07:05,374 --> 01:07:07,747
What do you think?
It should be a bailout amount..

782
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:08,857
Let us ask ₹100,000

783
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:10,824
Fuck your father! That money won't stick

784
01:07:10,996 --> 01:07:12,794
Why do you want to steal from others?

785
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,872
Greedy fellow...You are like your mom

786
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:17,500
How much is our debt? 5000

787
01:07:17,863 --> 01:07:19,233
2000 for the cock

788
01:07:19,627 --> 01:07:21,903
Another 1000 for stay and travel

789
01:07:22,198 --> 01:07:23,520
Let us ask for 8000

790
01:07:23,568 --> 01:07:26,302
Are you really an idiot or just act like one?

791
01:07:44,368 --> 01:07:48,026
Hello, this is Kalaiyaan speaking. The stiff is with me.

792
01:07:48,933 --> 01:07:50,064
Which stuff?

793
01:07:50,226 --> 01:07:52,790
Whiteman's snuff. Bava lodge.

794
01:07:52,967 --> 01:07:53,942
Haa

795
01:07:54,262 --> 01:07:56,585
I am by the broken clock tower.

796
01:07:56,623 --> 01:07:59,239
But I got no time. Hurry up.

797
01:07:59,373 --> 01:08:00,006
Haa ?

798
01:08:00,913 --> 01:08:04,645
Green dhoti. Sandal shirt. Blood all over it. A towel

799
01:08:04,933 --> 01:08:06,284
You?

800
01:08:06,304 --> 01:08:07,872
Red Maruti car?

801
01:08:07,973 --> 01:08:10,107
Bring 200,000 with you

802
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:11,177
Ok Ok Ok

803
01:08:11,317 --> 01:08:12,171
Haa  Hello

804
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:15,919
Don't forget to bring two lakhs................No mention..

805
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:21,605
What do you think now? Impressed ?

806
01:08:21,748 --> 01:08:23,099
I am unmarried

807
01:08:27,813 --> 01:08:31,141
I love tender coconut...

808
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,450
Sweet  ...  Sweet....

809
01:08:34,564 --> 01:08:38,466
Hey Jokers, he is by the broken clock tower..... go..

810
01:08:41,234 --> 01:08:44,119
But you have to accept a fact, Kodukkapuli

811
01:08:44,808 --> 01:08:47,885
Your dad is smarter than my dad......ha.

812
01:08:57,376 --> 01:08:58,927
Hey Kodukkapuli

813
01:08:59,072 --> 01:09:01,470
We don't know if these folks are good or bad

814
01:09:01,515 --> 01:09:04,021
What if they beat us and steal the stuff?

815
01:09:04,047 --> 01:09:07,106
Oh yeah. You are smart for real.

816
01:09:07,271 --> 01:09:07,748
Ha

817
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:10,660
You don't know a lot about your dad

818
01:09:12,045 --> 01:09:14,126
Can you give me the bag?

819
01:09:16,405 --> 01:09:18,127
Let me go hide this bag

820
01:09:18,212 --> 01:09:20,052
If they show up, sternly say it to them..

821
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:22,567
'Show the money, have the honey'

822
01:09:22,988 --> 01:09:25,176
Kodukkapuli, where are you hiding it?

823
01:09:25,219 --> 01:09:29,521
- I won't tell. You are a blabber mouth
- All of him is poison. (lovingly)

824
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:12,645
Shit! The chasers at the lodge are in the Maruti car

825
01:11:14,539 --> 01:11:16,623
(approaching car)

826
01:11:21,427 --> 01:11:26,002
Dad!

827
01:11:26,568 --> 01:11:28,537
Pa .... Pa..

828
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,076
Pa

829
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:48,629
My silver pistol is missing

830
01:11:48,918 --> 01:11:50,734
Did you take it?
(Maruti van door opening)

831
01:11:50,774 --> 01:11:52,061
No

832
01:11:55,767 --> 01:11:58,165
(Van door locking)
I swear, I don't know

833
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:21,152
Him?

834
01:12:25,401 --> 01:12:27,417
Small world........

835
01:12:28,343 --> 01:12:30,771
Hello sir... (someone answering a phone call) Tell me sir...

836
01:12:31,273 --> 01:12:32,502
Do you know English?

837
01:12:33,263 --> 01:12:33,966
No.. No..

838
01:12:34,248 --> 01:12:34,998
Aah..

839
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:40,879
I got a call that Pasupathy escaped from Mullu

840
01:12:50,924 --> 01:12:53,169
If my guess is right...

841
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,521
Pasupathy will join Gajendran to cause trouble

842
01:12:55,639 --> 01:12:57,886
If not, he will pull his loyal men to create a new gang

843
01:12:57,949 --> 01:13:01,393
I have to ruin it somehow

844
01:13:04,401 --> 01:13:06,862
Call Sub-Inspector Mayilvahanan

845
01:13:07,135 --> 01:13:09,766
We have to "leak information" to Gajendran

846
01:13:09,953 --> 01:13:13,326
That bitch won't believe, if it came directly from us

847
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:17,657
'Enemy's enemy is a friend'

848
01:13:17,831 --> 01:13:19,684
.. it is Ayya's mantra

849
01:13:20,019 --> 01:13:22,279
If my guess is right....

850
01:13:23,581 --> 01:13:26,005
Sir, I have to meet Mullu at your police station?

851
01:13:26,647 --> 01:13:28,569
Can you arrange that?

852
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:30,672
Hey, he won't show up

853
01:13:30,789 --> 01:13:33,669
Why will Gajendran's man agree to meet Ayya's man?

854
01:13:33,768 --> 01:13:36,445
Tell him it's Pasupathy, he will show up today

855
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:40,810
- ₹ 2000

856
01:13:41,382 --> 01:13:42,833
- I will pay in the evening

857
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:46,559
Will you be alive till then? Ha... Ha .... Ha..

858
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:47,747
Ha

859
01:13:49,946 --> 01:13:53,188
Hey Gajendran, how much cash do you got at hand?

860
01:13:53,334 --> 01:13:57,822
- What the cunt-hair for?
- I have some good information for you

861
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:17,536
Clairvoyance, anyone..

862
01:14:18,411 --> 01:14:20,505
May I palm read your future ?

863
01:14:20,575 --> 01:14:23,052
I can read the past and the future

864
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:26,695
I think you don't believe me...swami

865
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:32,476
Swami ! Think of 2 flowers, let me read your palm only if I get them right..

866
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:35,285
Have you picked them? swami ?

867
01:14:35,332 --> 01:14:37,962
Swami, There are flowers of different kind, color, smell

868
01:14:38,488 --> 01:14:41,144
There is Lily, Lotus, Chrysanthemum and more

869
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:43,214
But they are not what you picked...swami

870
01:14:43,337 --> 01:14:47,083
They are not daisy, water lily, chrysanthemum or ghanera .... swami

871
01:14:47,426 --> 01:14:50,109
You thought of a white colored flower

872
01:14:50,172 --> 01:14:52,512
And one in pink color

873
01:14:53,654 --> 01:14:56,218
The two flowers you picked are...

874
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:58,690
Jasmine and Rose

875
01:14:58,931 --> 01:15:00,459
Correct, Sir?

876
01:15:00,772 --> 01:15:01,811
No........No.........

877
01:15:07,661 --> 01:15:10,896
Swamy ! What are those two flowers you had picked?

878
01:15:12,433 --> 01:15:14,262
Andy Flower and Grant Flower

879
01:15:28,601 --> 01:15:31,184
- What is this shit?
- I told you earlier but no one believed

880
01:15:31,246 --> 01:15:35,109
- He shot at me. But at blank point, he let Mullu live
- I am done with this shit

881
01:15:35,585 --> 01:15:39,264
Gajapathy, this is the station. Can't kill anyone here

882
01:15:40,074 --> 01:15:44,625
We saw them meet secretly. Let us hear what Mullu has to say

883
01:16:13,388 --> 01:16:15,693
- Mullu, why are you late?
- It got late

884
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:17,710
Where? At the police station?

885
01:16:21,352 --> 01:16:24,029
- What did you talk about?
- We spoke nothing

886
01:16:24,671 --> 01:16:27,604
- How much did he offer?
- We didn't speak shit

887
01:16:27,619 --> 01:16:30,662
- Why not?
- Because he is a dumb cunt

888
01:16:30,709 --> 01:16:34,388
He had a chance to kill you, why didn't he?

889
01:16:39,188 --> 01:16:40,818
I am asking you

890
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:43,700
I told you. Can't you understand the first time?

891
01:16:43,927 --> 01:16:45,840
Are you that stupid?

892
01:16:45,972 --> 01:16:49,699
He is paying the cop to meet you. Yet he said nothing?

893
01:16:50,169 --> 01:16:51,934
Because he is a dumb cunt

894
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:57,346
He took your gun.. had it on your head...

895
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,119
Yet he shot at someone far away and not you?

896
01:17:01,314 --> 01:17:03,981
Because he is a dumb cunt

897
01:17:05,025 --> 01:17:06,366
Mullu...

898
01:17:06,403 --> 01:17:09,150
..if I believe it, I am the dumb cunt

899
01:17:15,649 --> 01:17:17,773
Do you think this is wrong?

900
01:17:18,018 --> 01:17:22,176
Subbu, worm is eaten by fish, fish is eaten by man. It's life!

901
01:17:22,694 --> 01:17:24,777
When you put it that way

902
01:17:25,162 --> 01:17:27,568
Can we do it right?

903
01:17:28,073 --> 01:17:31,394
Let me repeat our plan. See if it is good

904
01:17:31,762 --> 01:17:34,827
When we go home, Ayya will be in a afternoon nap

905
01:17:35,209 --> 01:17:37,396
Key will be under his pillow.

906
01:17:37,498 --> 01:17:41,176
We will take the safe key out and get the bag

907
01:17:41,868 --> 01:17:44,499
Lock it and leave the keys in the same spot Subbu!

908
01:17:44,686 --> 01:17:46,750
That's your only responsibility

909
01:17:46,877 --> 01:17:48,923
I will leave the bag at the corner shop

910
01:17:49,001 --> 01:17:52,026
.. and tell him that 'We will get the bag later'

911
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,580
When Ayya wakes up, ask him that you want to see a movie.

912
01:17:55,627 --> 01:17:58,741
Ayya wouldn't let you alone, so he will send me along

913
01:17:58,951 --> 01:18:01,554
We will leave as if we are going to movies ...

914
01:18:01,653 --> 01:18:04,594
- ... grab the bag and escape!
- Escape!

915
01:18:17,294 --> 01:18:19,990
Movie is 3 hours. To and fro is 2 hours.

916
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,708
For 5 hours, Singaperumal won't look for us

917
01:18:23,627 --> 01:18:25,798
By then, we would be in Andra

918
01:18:25,858 --> 01:18:27,808
-  That's all
- easy

919
01:18:27,857 --> 01:18:28,334
easy

920
01:18:33,159 --> 01:18:35,794
Watch out Subbu, you know nothing

921
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,107
You are safe, because I was here

922
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,044
But you are always going to be with me

923
01:18:46,104 --> 01:18:51,724
Subbu ! Did you notice that I called Ayya as 'Singaperumal'?

924
01:18:52,663 --> 01:18:56,435
Fear is still there, but braveness has come

925
01:19:44,271 --> 01:19:48,799
(Kaalaiyan crying in pain)

926
01:19:57,119 --> 01:19:58,943
I really don't know

927
01:20:00,678 --> 01:20:02,251
Where?

928
01:20:05,255 --> 01:20:08,357
My son has hid it somewhere

929
01:20:08,648 --> 01:20:10,661
Where is your son?

930
01:20:13,789 --> 01:20:16,380
Where is your son?

931
01:20:17,893 --> 01:20:19,820
Where is he now?

932
01:20:20,497 --> 01:20:22,776
Wherever you caught me...

933
01:20:22,856 --> 01:20:24,482
..he is somewhere near by

934
01:20:24,904 --> 01:20:27,908
I don't know where he is now

935
01:20:27,935 --> 01:20:28,622
Hey !

936
01:20:29,331 --> 01:20:30,861
Let him go

937
01:20:30,949 --> 01:20:31,371
Ah!

938
01:20:33,989 --> 01:20:36,356
This morning, you killed my fighting cock

939
01:20:37,492 --> 01:20:39,644
I didn't take it personally

940
01:20:40,246 --> 01:20:43,197
You didn't care I am an Aristocrat

941
01:20:43,542 --> 01:20:45,966
You beat me up..... Haa

942
01:20:46,504 --> 01:20:49,130
I didn't take it personally either

943
01:20:49,751 --> 01:20:53,279
But let us stop everything here, OK?

944
01:20:55,021 --> 01:20:55,864
ok ?

945
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:58,716
We can stop

946
01:20:58,805 --> 01:21:00,356
But you are not telling me the truth

947
01:21:00,412 --> 01:21:02,060
But I told everything I know

948
01:21:02,661 --> 01:21:10,224
(Kaalaiyan crying out in pain)

949
01:21:12,314 --> 01:21:14,799
I am really scared Subbu

950
01:21:14,896 --> 01:21:17,034
What if we mess it up?

951
01:21:19,025 --> 01:21:20,450
Let's drop all of it

952
01:21:20,498 --> 01:21:23,117
Let us not see each other or talk

953
01:21:23,115 --> 01:21:26,161
You are alive, that's enough for me

954
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,819
Don't want any of these plans

955
01:21:34,243 --> 01:21:37,417
- Why Subbu?
- Listen to me, no!

956
01:21:39,118 --> 01:21:41,297
If Ayya once....

957
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:43,723
just once...

958
01:21:43,896 --> 01:21:46,428
...suspects a little bit

959
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:50,051
I don't care what happens to me, but you...

960
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,039
What were we thinking?

961
01:21:53,696 --> 01:21:54,956
Who is he?

962
01:21:55,448 --> 01:21:57,436
He controls the whole city

963
01:21:58,085 --> 01:22:00,406
We are just some idiots.... fools

964
01:22:01,122 --> 01:22:02,184
Subbu !

965
01:22:02,304 --> 01:22:04,713
Let's not do this plan, please

966
01:22:05,232 --> 01:22:06,514
Why Subbu?

967
01:22:06,773 --> 01:22:09,065
Because I really love you a lot..

968
01:22:17,606 --> 01:22:20,622
Sorry !  Sorry for everything...

969
01:22:32,711 --> 01:22:37,365
hug me one last time.........please

970
01:22:47,252 --> 01:22:49,872
But I don't like being here

971
01:22:51,017 --> 01:22:53,066
Let us take a risk

972
01:22:53,154 --> 01:22:54,545
Let's escape .........

973
01:22:55,091 --> 01:22:56,012
Why?

974
01:22:56,632 --> 01:22:58,629
Because I love you too

975
01:23:01,084 --> 01:23:02,568
Scream of pain......

976
01:23:21,998 --> 01:23:23,120
Whore!

977
01:23:24,015 --> 01:23:25,791
Beat me now

978
01:23:25,882 --> 01:23:26,990
Beat me

979
01:23:27,247 --> 01:23:29,215
I got my son.. he will destroy you

980
01:23:29,465 --> 01:23:32,669
He is smart.. he will destroy you ....

981
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,090
What the fuck is this shit?

982
01:23:49,139 --> 01:23:51,055
We can't do anything for sometime

983
01:23:51,428 --> 01:23:53,075
Is it our stuff?

984
01:23:57,787 --> 01:24:01,466
Look at this village idiot's valor

985
01:24:04,044 --> 01:24:06,622
10,000 lost on fucking nothing

986
01:24:07,202 --> 01:24:09,357
Now, where to search for his son?

987
01:25:05,714 --> 01:25:07,525
Why did you take my dad?

988
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:09,995
We told we were returning the powder

989
01:25:10,558 --> 01:25:12,686
Wrong number

990
01:25:40,261 --> 01:25:42,914
Hey yellow shirt, the call is for you

991
01:25:47,474 --> 01:25:48,302
Hello ?

992
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:51,544
- Hey !  Which powder are you talking about?
- The one in Bava Lodge

993
01:25:52,506 --> 01:25:55,559
- Where is that powder?
- It is with me

994
01:25:55,834 --> 01:25:59,240
- Where are you?
- Let go of my dad, I will tell you

995
01:25:59,752 --> 01:26:01,498
- I don't have your dad

996
01:26:01,758 --> 01:26:03,867
- He spoke to you on phone

997
01:26:03,959 --> 01:26:07,638
- To me? This number?
- Hmm

998
01:26:08,116 --> 01:26:09,349
Do you have another number?

999
01:26:09,413 --> 01:26:10,607
Should I call them?

1000
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:13,629
Listen .. Listen ... Listen...........don't...don't..

1001
01:26:14,351 --> 01:26:16,849
Don't call them. If you do...

1002
01:26:16,903 --> 01:26:19,285
...they will take you too

1003
01:26:21,233 --> 01:26:24,320
Give the stuff to me, I will save your dad

1004
01:26:24,578 --> 01:26:26,817
How do I trust you?

1005
01:26:29,607 --> 01:26:30,303
Ok...

1006
01:26:31,078 --> 01:26:34,383
Whoever took your dad, took my wife too

1007
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:39,716
Give the stuff to me...I will save your dad

1008
01:26:39,904 --> 01:26:41,989
You couldn't keep your wife safe...

1009
01:26:42,044 --> 01:26:44,628
..how are you going to save my dad?

1010
01:26:44,682 --> 01:26:48,196
Hell with you, then call them. They will take you too.

1011
01:26:48,405 --> 01:26:50,824
Do you have any other option?

1012
01:26:51,178 --> 01:26:53,737
That's why you are calling this number.

1013
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:57,216
I will save him, not for you or your dad

1014
01:26:57,283 --> 01:27:00,613
..because I want my wife back..that's why

1015
01:27:00,987 --> 01:27:02,944
Don't call them

1016
01:27:03,876 --> 01:27:05,576
Will you?

1017
01:27:05,639 --> 01:27:07,645
I won't

1018
01:27:09,187 --> 01:27:10,599
OK.

1019
01:27:11,089 --> 01:27:12,966
Come to AK mills at 5

1020
01:27:13,345 --> 01:27:15,734
Do you know where it is?

1021
01:27:16,689 --> 01:27:18,913
It is near by, ask around

1022
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,202
My name is Pasupathy

1023
01:27:21,621 --> 01:27:24,128
I am Kodukkapuli

1024
01:27:42,274 --> 01:27:44,864
What's with the on-time payments?

1025
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:49,176
What did you speak with Mullu?

1026
01:27:52,919 --> 01:27:54,869
It's way more than I want

1027
01:27:55,111 --> 01:27:58,154
Sir, I need another help, keep it as advance

1028
01:27:58,808 --> 01:28:00,317
I am listening

1029
01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:03,833
The stuff everyone's looking for... I have it

1030
01:28:04,224 --> 01:28:05,068
Haa ?

1031
01:28:05,764 --> 01:28:08,285
I am ready to return it to Ayya..

1032
01:28:08,332 --> 01:28:10,416
...instead Kasthuri and a man called 'Kaalaiyan'

1033
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:12,234
..ask for their release

1034
01:28:12,416 --> 01:28:16,096
Sir, I won't cause him trouble, neither should he

1035
01:28:16,849 --> 01:28:19,505
Only you can talk and make him compromise

1036
01:28:19,865 --> 01:28:21,700
Why don't you speak?

1037
01:28:22,954 --> 01:28:25,517
Ask me to beat up 4, I can...

1038
01:28:25,618 --> 01:28:28,217
...I can't think and speak

1039
01:28:28,771 --> 01:28:32,450
I said something this morning and it has gone this far

1040
01:28:33,329 --> 01:28:36,513
Sir,  I know you can make it happen

1041
01:28:39,145 --> 01:28:41,253
Ok, give me your phone

1042
01:28:43,638 --> 01:28:46,926
Use your phone, I will pay for it

1043
01:28:47,394 --> 01:28:49,428
Why are you talking like that?

1044
01:28:54,544 --> 01:28:55,223
Haa ..

1045
01:29:01,312 --> 01:29:06,772
Hey !  At 5:30, Pasupathy will bring the stuff to AK mills...

1046
01:29:07,379 --> 01:29:09,398
Go take it

1047
01:29:10,594 --> 01:29:11,998
What?

1048
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:13,573
I am thinking

1049
01:29:13,643 --> 01:29:16,570
What are you thinking? 'Thinking-ka-baal'

1050
01:29:16,764 --> 01:29:19,278
As in, what do with Pasupathy?

1051
01:29:20,806 --> 01:29:22,466
Kiss and make out with him

1052
01:29:22,581 --> 01:29:24,904
Go kill him. Leave!

1053
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:28,712
Hey !

1054
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:32,740
At least this time, do the job right!

1055
01:29:33,855 --> 01:29:37,635
And don't bring his mom or gradmom this time

1056
01:29:39,655 --> 01:29:41,140
I don't want them

1057
01:29:43,145 --> 01:29:45,189
Go, do it!

1058
01:30:04,162 --> 01:30:22,568
♪ (Vaa vaa pakkam vaa from Thanga Magan) ♪

1059
01:31:47,413 --> 01:31:52,145
Hey ! Call me if Marwari seth comes. I Have to return the cash...

1060

Hurry up

1076

What if Ayya asks about me?

1077
01:33:24,939 --> 01:33:27,164
OK. I will make an excuse

1078
01:33:27,899 --> 01:33:29,646
Wait a minute

1079
01:33:32,121 --> 01:33:33,606
I am scared

1080
01:33:41,547 --> 01:33:45,566
- Why do we need that?
- Just in case. Keep it

1081
01:33:59,771 --> 01:34:03,927
Be careful..Keep an eye out.

1082
01:34:05,826 --> 01:34:07,083
Bye..bye..

1083
01:34:28,650 --> 01:34:31,380
Why are you late? Where is the powder?

1084
01:34:31,457 --> 01:34:33,501
Where is my dad?

1085
01:34:34,597 --> 01:34:38,489
I told you I will get him. Go fetch it. Go!

1086
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:41,783
Hey ! I told you. Go get it.

1087
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:44,455
Show my dad, only then I will give it.

1088
01:34:45,727 --> 01:34:47,829
Is your dad with me?  Haa ?

1089
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:53,145
Listen. Give me powder. I will exchange that for your dad. Go

1090
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:56,216
Then why will I give it to you? I will give it to them

1091
01:34:56,459 --> 01:34:58,115
Hay ... Hay... Hay...

1092
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:01,808
You little prick. Fucking my patience.. I will kill you.

1093
01:35:02,027 --> 01:35:05,610
Why can't you understand?

1094
01:35:07,252 --> 01:35:08,181
Go..

1095
01:36:00,857 --> 01:36:04,777
I am gonna trust you. Don't betray me

1096
01:36:05,907 --> 01:36:07,338
- Hey ! You stay here

1097
01:36:07,583 --> 01:36:09,110
- I will come with you

1098
01:36:11,248 --> 01:36:14,052
- Where is my dad?
- These guys are different

1099
01:36:15,462 --> 01:36:18,916
If you think I am a little boy, I will cut you up
If I don't get my dad, I will murder you.

1100
01:36:19,326 --> 01:36:21,279
If I don't get my dad,
I will murder you.

1101
01:36:21,413 --> 01:36:23,539
Give the bag, I will take care

1102
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:26,919
I will get your dad, like I told you

1103
01:36:29,079 --> 01:36:30,992
Stay here

1104
01:36:58,147 --> 01:36:59,446
Gajendran

1105
01:36:59,736 --> 01:37:02,109
A lot have gone wrong between us

1106
01:37:02,522 --> 01:37:06,360
I will return the goods back to you. Lets not fight

1107
01:37:07,295 --> 01:37:09,524
Gajapathy, you get this

1108
01:37:10,097 --> 01:37:13,149
I will explain the problem, you will understand

1109
01:37:21,339 --> 01:37:27,144
- Gajapathy
- First, I will check the goods. We can cut him after

1110
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:35,699
I wanted to do quick business, but I messed it up. Sorry!

1111
01:38:58,204 --> 01:39:01,982
Do you ever think before acting? Dumb cunt

1112
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:06,583
Gajapathy

1113
01:39:09,304 --> 01:39:11,849
There is thin line between Idiot and genius..

1114
01:39:11,897 --> 01:39:14,785
.. I am crossing that line now

1115
01:39:18,212 --> 01:39:19,640
I pissed off Ayya

1116
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:21,651
But he is a heavy weight

1117
01:39:23,322 --> 01:39:25,185
I can do anything against him alone

1118
01:39:25,229 --> 01:39:27,281
I need another heavy weight for that

1119
01:39:27,853 --> 01:39:30,069
Gajendran is a heavy weight, but..

1120
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:32,187
..he was pissed off too

1121
01:39:32,545 --> 01:39:35,942
If Gajendran gets psychotic mad, he will annihilate

1122
01:39:36,102 --> 01:39:38,925
But he doesn't get angry like Gajapathy

1123
01:39:39,632 --> 01:39:42,387
I will have to mess with him... to make him do what I need

1124
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:43,982
Think. Think. Think.

1125
01:39:44,437 --> 01:39:46,644
My first step - Mullu

1126
01:39:46,778 --> 01:39:49,155
Why am I here, if you are not talking? Dumb cunt!

1127
01:39:49,255 --> 01:39:52,701
That triggered Gajendran. Now he is angry

1128
01:39:53,456 --> 01:39:55,736
But not angry enough...

1129
01:39:59,516 --> 01:40:03,092
Step 2 - To get Gajendran and Gajapathy with the gang

1130
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:05,001
... to a place of my choosing

1131
01:40:06,324 --> 01:40:08,255
..you can make it happen..

1132
01:40:10,114 --> 01:40:11,605
Hello Gajendran

1133
01:40:11,678 --> 01:40:14,766
If he said 5:30, we should be there early..before Ayya's men

1134
01:40:14,826 --> 01:40:18,302
My last step - Gajapathy

1135
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:22,857
Now... Gajendran is maniac mad

1136
01:40:23,097 --> 01:40:25,162
Anger is blinding his eyes

1137
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:55,514
Why I tried so hard to make Gajendran...
... so mad at me ?   WHY?

1138
01:40:55,835 --> 01:40:57,607
For this!

1139
01:40:58,421 --> 01:41:01,062
Brother, they are here

1140
01:41:04,721 --> 01:41:07,218
Singaperumal, you son of a whore

1141
01:41:09,779 --> 01:41:11,021
Kill them all

1142
01:41:11,275 --> 01:41:13,974
Pasupathy and Singaperumal have been playing me

1143
01:41:14,216 --> 01:41:16,255
Why did I was certain that they will end up fighting?

1144
01:41:16,579 --> 01:41:18,044
Enemy's enemy is a friend. True...

1145
01:41:18,067 --> 01:41:19,263
But more importantly...

1146
01:41:19,288 --> 01:41:21,738
...they both are still enemies

1147
01:42:19,845 --> 01:42:21,271
Hey Subbu...

1148
01:42:21,488 --> 01:42:23,161
Who was on the phone?

1149
01:42:23,551 --> 01:42:24,324
Haa !

1150
01:42:24,351 --> 01:42:26,213
(kitchen utensils clanging)

1151
01:42:26,326 --> 01:42:27,209
Subbu

1152
01:42:45,976 --> 01:42:49,639
Subbu... Sappa...

1153
01:42:51,615 --> 01:42:52,342
Subbu

1154
01:42:52,803 --> 01:42:53,506
Subbu

1155
01:42:55,022 --> 01:42:56,713
Where is the bag?

1156
01:42:58,138 --> 01:43:00,068
Where is Sappa?

1157
01:43:00,443 --> 01:43:02,437
Where is Suppa?

1158
01:43:08,856 --> 01:43:10,589
I don't know

1159
01:43:17,638 --> 01:43:21,200
Hay Hay! Sappa escaped with the bag full of money.... go..

1160
01:43:21,751 --> 01:43:24,207
Go. Catch him. Kill him..

1161
01:43:24,259 --> 01:43:26,793
Hay !  Sappa ran with the money, find him!

1162
01:43:26,878 --> 01:43:28,370
Go .....Go.........Go..

1163
01:43:48,484 --> 01:43:50,155
Where did you go?

1164
01:43:52,989 --> 01:43:55,331
Madam asked to buy fruits

1165
01:43:58,389 --> 01:44:00,151
Where is the money?

1166
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:04,353
Where is the bag?

1167
01:44:09,245 --> 01:44:11,905
Sappa bitch! Tell me

1168
01:44:12,068 --> 01:44:14,708
Where is the bag?

1169
01:44:22,875 --> 01:44:25,380
Are you looking for this?

1170
01:44:31,681 --> 01:44:34,193
You are trying to kill me?

1171
01:44:35,736 --> 01:44:38,763
What you feared is true, Subbu...

1172
01:45:20,036 --> 01:45:21,310
Did you mess it up Subbu?

1173
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,294
No, I didn't

1174
01:45:25,103 --> 01:45:29,546
Make her cry somehow.... ..Console her ......and then screw her!

1175
01:45:33,936 --> 01:45:35,919
What if we steal from our Ayya?

1176
01:45:36,357 --> 01:45:38,497
I am scared Subbu

1177
01:45:38,809 --> 01:45:40,593
If we mess it up?

1178
01:45:40,709 --> 01:45:42,819
Lets drop all plans

1179
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:45,744
- Lets risk it Subbu
- Why?

1180
01:45:46,282 --> 01:45:48,872
Because I love you too

1181
01:45:52,054 --> 01:45:53,794
Just in case. Keep it

1182
01:46:07,674 --> 01:46:09,158
Hey! Sobbu..

1183
01:46:13,245 --> 01:46:17,528
Everyone thinks he is a looser..
But actually he is the real Don !

1184
01:46:17,758 --> 01:46:20,183
Fucking Joker !

1185
01:47:16,062 --> 01:47:17,936
Sappa shot Ayya?

1186
01:47:19,911 --> 01:47:21,988
So you killed Sappa for that?

1187
01:47:28,521 --> 01:47:30,778
You have suffered a lot here..

1188
01:47:33,962 --> 01:47:36,366
I will take care. Leave

1189
01:48:02,211 --> 01:48:03,606
Ayya, tell me

1190
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:06,250
This is not Ayya....Pasupathy

1191
01:48:08,855 --> 01:48:10,806
Singaperumal tried to kill me

1192
01:48:12,090 --> 01:48:14,013
Now, he is not alive

1193
01:48:14,876 --> 01:48:16,622
I killed Gajendran

1194
01:48:17,089 --> 01:48:18,690
Killed Gajapathy

1195
01:48:19,407 --> 01:48:21,139
Nagaraj is out of picture too

1196
01:48:22,022 --> 01:48:23,664
Now on, it's just me

1197
01:48:24,843 --> 01:48:27,122
I know you did this for Ayya

1198
01:48:27,490 --> 01:48:29,306
I am not angry at you

1199
01:48:32,504 --> 01:48:36,300
But, Kasthuri needs to be here... now

1200
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,750
Take him to the hospital

1201
01:49:17,768 --> 01:49:20,317
- Do you love your dad so much?
- Not like that

1202
01:49:20,388 --> 01:49:22,260
But he is my dad

1203
01:49:54,877 --> 01:49:56,767
Had any problem?

1204
01:50:11,941 --> 01:50:14,211
What happened to the money?

1205
01:50:14,667 --> 01:50:16,432
Sappa hid it somewhere ..

1206
01:50:16,533 --> 01:50:18,215
That dog is dead now

1207
01:50:28,094 --> 01:50:30,189
Thank you so much

1208
01:50:30,223 --> 01:50:33,654
- How is Ayya doing?
- He is very good

1209
01:50:55,442 --> 01:50:56,966
Someone who will listen to me

1210
01:50:57,003 --> 01:50:58,878
Someone to blame for the money

1211
01:50:59,142 --> 01:51:00,689
I needed an Idiot for that

1212
01:51:00,987 --> 01:51:02,352
He was Sappa

1213
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:05,225
Poor looser? Not really.. he is innocent

1214
01:51:05,477 --> 01:51:07,174
Just like he said...

1215
01:51:07,415 --> 01:51:10,965
'Worm, fish, man...life is like that'

1216
01:51:11,137 --> 01:51:13,477
As far as I am concerned, Sappa is just another man...

1217
01:51:13,539 --> 01:51:15,969
All men are sappa (Looser) too

1218
01:51:16,327 --> 01:51:20,511
The best thing about being woman is ... its a man's world.

1219
01:51:26,317 --> 01:51:29,240
Watch out Subbu, you know nothing

1220
01:51:35,771 --> 01:51:37,982
You are safe, because I was here

1221
01:51:38,088 --> 01:51:39,597
Idiot

1222
01:52:02,702 --> 01:52:05,599
NagaDutta : Vishnugupta, what is dharma?

1223
01:52:05,630 --> 01:52:09,622
Vishnugupta Chankya : Dharma is doing what is necessary
