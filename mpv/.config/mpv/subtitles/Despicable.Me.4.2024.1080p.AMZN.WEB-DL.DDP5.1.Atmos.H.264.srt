one of the Anti-Villain

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,752
And trust me, a real jerk.

42
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:53,756
So, there is no room for error.
Got it?

43
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,508
Si, boss.

44
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,679

Looka! Looka! Oh!

50
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,151
Yummos!

51
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,652
Come here, come here.

52
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,156
Ah.

53
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,824
Pusha. Pusha.

54
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,868
Ah...

55
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,787
-Helpa. Ah, helpa.
-Ah.

56
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,706
Ah. Oh, helpa.

57
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,376
Kids can be so cruel,

58
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,795
but Maxime can be even crueler!

59
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,718
Oh!

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,053
Well, well, well.

61
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,429
Look who it is.

62
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,390
If it isn't Gru-ser the Loser.

63
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,018
Well, if it isn't Maxime Le Mal.

64
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,186
You look...

65
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,812
Magnificent?

66
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,022
Yes, I know.

67
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,066
What did you think, huh?
I was going to look

68
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,194
like a bald loser
with a dad bod?

69
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,279
Oops, looks like
you beat me to it, no?

70
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,615
Well, that's not...

71
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,826
Ooh!

72
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,161
Oh.

73
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,829
It's good to laugh, no?

74
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,542
Anyway, you remember
my girlfriend, Valentina?

75
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,671
She was captain of
the Femme Fatales cheer squad

76
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:18,258
and the most popular girl
in school, huh?

77
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,051
I remember.

78
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,095
Good to see you, Valentina.

79
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,766
What happened, Gru?

80
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,894
All your dreams of becoming
a famous villain,

81
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,354
they go poof-poof, huh?

82
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,482
Well, I don't know if you know,

83
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,901
but I did manage
to steal the moon.

84
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,027
Really?

85
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,113
You mean that moon?

86
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,367
Is this on?

87
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,786
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

88
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:51,624
Good evening, and welcome,
Lycee Pas Bon alumni.

89
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,836
Now, we're going to kick off
the festivities

90
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:58,923
by announcing the winner
of our most coveted award,

91
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,050
the Golden Alumni.

92
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,847
And so, without further ado,

93
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:11,728
the winner of this year's
Golden Alumni is, uh...

94
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:16,232
oh, my favorite student,
Maxime Le Mal!

95
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,900
-What? What?
-Oh, thank you.

96
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,235
Are you kidding me?

97
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,112
Thank you. Merci.
Merci beaucoup.

98
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,447
Mais non, you don't have to.

99
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,330
-Oh, thank you. Thank you.
-♪ You're unbelievable. ♪

100
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,622
Thank you.

101
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,458
I'm sure you all know
that I have

102
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,502
something very big in the works.

103
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,379
Now, some of you laughed

104
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,299
at my childhood obsession
with cockroaches.

105
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,301
But I quickly learned

106
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,970
that they are a miracle
of evolution.

107
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,809
And I have found a way
to harness the strength

108
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,687
and the speed and the--
what is the word?--

109
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,274
unsquishability of
the most powerful creature

110
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,817
on the planet.

111
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:05,073
Which makes me indestructible
and unstoppable!

112
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,157
Maxime!

113
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,451
Maxime! Maxime!

114
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,789
Behold, the power
of the cockroach!

115
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,426
Oh!

116
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,845
Ah.

117
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,267
Ah.

118
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,022
Aah, aah! Stop! Oh, oh, stoppa!

119
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,316
Aah! Stoppa!

120
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,318
So, my sad little friend,

121
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,445
what do you say about that, huh?

122
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,533
Well, I'd say
you're under arrest,

123
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,619
courtesy of
the Anti-Villain League.

124
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,455
Oh, I don't think so, mon ami.

125
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,207
Oh, yeah? Goop Grenade!

126
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,512
Move in.

127
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,180
-AVL!
-Stay where you are!

128
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,265
Move, move, move!

129
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,235
Stay there!

130
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,612
Freeze!

131
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,370
Gotcha.

132
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,830
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No!

133
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,290
This is not happening.

134
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,250
C'est impossible.

135
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,918
Get your hands off of me!

136
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,421
I...
I am commanding you to let...

137
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,299
So long, Maxime.

138
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,301
Who's the loser now?

139
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,427
Loser!

140
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,304
Loser! Loser!

141
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,232
This is not over!

142
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,444
You won't always have the AVL

143
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,029
to fight your battles,
you coward.

144
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,449
Mark my words,
I will exterminate you!

145
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,535
What?

146
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,458
Not, uh... not scary at all.

147
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,768
Hello, everybody.

148
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,603
-Gru, what's up?
-Hey, Gru!

149
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,563
-Hey, Gru.
-I'm so happy you're here!

150
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,649
What's shaking in the Gru house?

151
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,817
Look what I taught Lucky.

152
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,529
Lucky, sit.

153
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,367
Aw, Lucky. I said "sit."

154
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:00,831
Well, it is only
his first lesson.

155
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,376
Uh, maybe we practice outside
from now on.

156
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,753
There's my favorite husband.

157
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,797
Did you remember
to get the milk?

158
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,757
Well, yes. They had a few kinds.

159
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,134
They got the almond milk,
soy milk, hemp milk,

160
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,346
oat milk, goat milk,
chocolate milk, half-and-half,

161
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,682
powdered and of magnesia.

162
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,892
What about regular milk?

163
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,270
Uh, they don't make that
anymore.

164
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,479
Oh.

165
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,064
Wait a minute.

166
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,858
One, two, three girls.

167
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,068
One wife.

168
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,696
Something is missing.

169
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,865
No, I think that's
all of us, yeah.

170
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,577
You know what,
I keep forgetting-- this guy!

171
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,455
Oh!

172
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,582
There's my boy!

173
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,667
There he is.

174
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,502
A-coochie-coochie-
coochie-coochie.

175
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,505
Where is Daddy's hug?

176
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,716
Oh, looks like somebody's
a little cranky.

177
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,261
Behind that sourpuss,

178
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,763
I know you love your dada!

179
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,224
Go on, say it. "Dada."

180
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,851
"Dada."

181
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,311
Yes, of course he loves you.

182
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,564
He just... he just doesn't
show it on his face.

183
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,024
Or with his body language.

184
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,610
Right, Gru Jr.? Come on.

185
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,737
Show Daddy
how much you love him.

186
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,365
Oh, I know what
will make you happy.

187
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,701
Mmm. Bahama Medley.

188
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,788
No?

189
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,374
It's from the Bahamas--
all of them.

190
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,669
Look. Oh, so yummy.

191
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,004
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

192
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,593
Oh, that really tastes
like the Bahamas.

193
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,595
See? He loves his daddy.

194
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,680
He's sharing.

195
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,684
Phil, Ralph, Ron.

196
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,130
Thanks, guys.

197
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,801
Ramsbottom?

198
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,512
"Bottom."

199
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,472
I need a word with you both.

200
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,932
-Sure, but what...
-I'm sorry,

201
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,350
there's no time for chitchat.

202
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,728
Maxime Le Mal has sent you
a message from prison.

203
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,023
Bonjour, Gru.

204
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,484
I know you can hear me,
so hear this.

205
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,738
You think you can humiliate me
and get away with it, yes?

206
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,990
But no!
When I break out of prison,

207
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,076
I'm coming for my revenge, Gru,

208
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,454
but this time,
I won't go so easy on you.

209
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,833
And I know where you live,

210
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,876
so you'd better sleep
with one eye open,

211
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,629
'cause you can't hide from me.

212
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,381
Sweet dreams, Gru-ser!

213
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,302
Don't worry,
he can't get out of there.

214
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,972
It's a maximum security prison.

215
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,890
Ah, yes, well, um...

216
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,059
he escaped yesterday.

217
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,227
What?!

218
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,770
Leave our home?

219
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,439
Oh, no, you're gonna love it.

220
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,023
It's-it's called the safe house,

221
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,942
and it's fun, and it's safe,

222
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,069
and it's fantastic,
and we're going.

223
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,655
Yeah, you'll get a new room,
go to a new school.

224
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,198
That'll be fun, right?

225
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,825
Everything's gonna be new.
We love new.

226
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,869
What about all my friends?

227
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,455
You'll make new friends,
probably better ones.

228
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,709
-I can't believe this.
-Yes, yes.

229
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,461
Lot of emotions,
big life change.

230
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,879
Less talking, more walking.

231
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,672
Come on. Here we go.

232
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,393
I'm sorry you can't go with us,
Lucky.

233
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,398
Take good care of him.

234
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,942
Be good, Lucky.

235
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:00,571
Don't forget to practice
your tricks.

236
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,453
We'll arrive at the AVL
safe house in a few hours.

237
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,580
Mayflower is a lovely town.

238
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,082
A lovely, safe, boring town.

239
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,959
Trust me,
it is for the best, Gru.

240
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,669
And what about Grandma?

241
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,171
And Uncle Dru?

242
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,257
I'm sorry, no one can know
of your whereabouts.

243
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,300
Not even family.

244
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,385
Bingo,
there's your silver lining.

245
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:26,180
And you promise to take care
of the other Minions?

246
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,475
They'll be safe and sound
at AVL headquarters.

247
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,602
I have big plans for them.

248
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,480
Good luck with that.

249
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,027

250
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,946

253
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,177
Quiet!

254
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,807
You are now on Carl's bus.

255
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,185
And Carl is
a longtime AVL employee

256
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,021
whose retirement benefits
are almost vested,

257
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,149
so while on Carl's bus,

258
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,318
you follow Carl's rules.

259
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,739
No shenanigans, no antics
and no tomfoolery.

260
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,324
Tom?

261
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,160
So this ends now,
or you're gonna see

262
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,831
a side of Carl
you do not want to see.

263
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,917
Do I make myself clear?!

264
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,294

Watch your hands.
What are you doing?

268
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,057

00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,434

00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,983
Here we are,
the town of Mayflower.

272
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,192
The safe house has been used

273
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,029
to protect our agents
for decades now.

274
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,947
Oh, look at that place.

275
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,408
Wow, look at these lawns,
the flowers.

276
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,785
Whoa, that is cool!

277
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,078
Are we really gonna live here?

278
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,955
-Look at that fountain!
-Whoa.

279
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,999
Awesome.

280
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,500
Oh, is that one ours?

281
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,669
-Uh, uh, looka.
-Whoa! -Look at that!

282
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,171
Oh, that's pretty!

283
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,256
I could get used to this.

284
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,054
Ooh, it looks like
a princess lives there!

285
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,514
And here it is.

286
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,018
Your new home.

287
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,524
Oh.

288
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,234
Hmm. No fountain.

289
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,570
I'm sure it's gonna be great.

290
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,280
Come on.

291
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,170
Wow, it's so...
cold and uninviting.

292
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,713
But in a homey kind of way.

293
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,006
What?

294
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,134
Yes, everything here
is AVL standard.

295
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,511
What it lacks in comfort,

296
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,638
it more than makes up for
in functionality.

297
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,475
Th-There's even a fully
automated lockdown mode.

298
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,935
Isn't that fun?

299
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,020
Ooh, full lockdown mode.

300
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,355
Yay.

301
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,607
It has a vending machine!

302
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,111
I love this place!

303
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,367
Uh, uh, looka.

304
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,163
This will be great.

305
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,957
All right, now down to business.

306
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,961
For your own safety, you'll all
be assuming new identities.

307
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,422
New identities?
Is that really necessary?

308
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,465
It's not up for debate, Gru.

309
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,301
Now, you are
a solar panel salesman.

310
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,680
Lucy, you're a hair stylist
at an upscale salon.

311
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,849
A hair stylist?

312
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,475
Yes! Jackpot!

313
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,436
Silas, did you choose that
because you knew

314
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,480
I cut my own hair and that
I would totally rock at this?

315
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,607
No.

316
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,151
"Chet Cunningham."

317
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,987
Da, that's got
a nice ring to it.

318
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,196
Girls.

319
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,698
Cool.

320
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,491
I'm Blair.

321
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,826
Britney?

322
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,369
My name is Bree?

323
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,788
Oh, come on. There are
worse names than Bree.

324
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,790
Yeah, like Blanche.

325
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,333
Yes, Margo.

326
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,753
Blanche?
Oh, that is a terrible name.

327
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,381
Imagine being named Blanche.

328
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,009
Truly, I cannot think
of a worse...

329
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,844
My name's Blanche, isn't it?

330
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,137
Yup.

331
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,764
Well, I'll get used to it.

332
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:40,184
Well, why don't you girls go
and pick out your rooms

333
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,561
while I have a word
with your parents?

334
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,940
Yes, I-I didn't want
to frighten the girls,

335
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,525
but it is absolutely crucial

336
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,861
you keep your true identities
under wraps.

337
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:55,157
Gru, you're going to have
to try to not be so Gru-ish.

338
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,742
What is that supposed to mean?

339
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,329
Well, I'm just saying you tend
to stand out in a crowd.

340
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,331
That's all. You know, you, uh...

341
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,666
Like the way you're always
cranky and irritable

342
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,127
and, uh, how you make things
a bit awkward

343
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,712
for everyone around you.

344
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,339
You do do that.

345
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,341
-I mean, you, you know, you...
-Okay, enough.

346
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,219
I don't make people awkward
or uncomfortable.

347
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,262
I'm very comforting.

348
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,264
Like a nice meat loaf.

349
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,600
I'm pretty delicious.

350
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,563
This is not awkward.

351
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,357
You're the ones
who are making it awkward.

352
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,484
Gru, you have to blend in.

353
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,611
Your family's lives
are at stake.

354
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,987
You understand?

355
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,697
Of course. Yes.
Fully understand.

356
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,534
We would do anything to keep
our family safe. Yeah.

357
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:42,121
Right, well, I'll be in contact
when this is all over.

358
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,998
Until then,
capturing Maxime Le Mal

359
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,459
is our top priority.

360
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,129
Stay safe.

361
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,550
You know what, Gru?
Maybe this isn't so bad.

362
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,927
We need a break
from chasing down villains

363
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,221
and dangerous missions, right?

364
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,557
We can actually be
a normal family for once.

365
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,184
And I can finally spend

366
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,062
some little bonding time
with the baby.

367
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,565
It's gonna be great, right, pal?

368
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,567
Who's got your nose?
Who's got...

369
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,528
Aah! He's got my nose!

370
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,114
Quite the grip there.

371
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,490
The kid is strong.

372
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,668

00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,019
Todd and Linda, where are you?
Where are you?

386
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,479
Yes. For distracting the guards.

387
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,023
Oh, très magnifique.

388
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,692
Now, silence!

389
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,112
We must make Gru suffer
for arresting me.

390
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,825
And what better way
than to take away from him

391
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,702
his precious little baby?

392
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,205
Oh, I want to take that baby!

393
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:53,085
-Oh, Maxime.
-No, no, wait, wait.

394
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,378
Not Maxime.

395
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,547
What if I start going
by Cockroach Man?

396
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,550
Huh? Little on the nose,
but it is very clear, huh?

397
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,219
It's good, no?

398
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,471
I'm not calling you
that stupid name,

399
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,057
but I love this evil plan.

400
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,642
Well, Gru has it coming.

401
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,561
He humiliated me
in front of the whole school.

402
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,773
I had my trophy and everything.

403
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,151
But now the game begins!

404
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,237
He runs and hides
like the mouse,

405
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,615
and we find him like the cat!

406
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,617
Game on.

407
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,164

408
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,084

409
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,505

415

Wait.

416
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,146
I can't say my name is Britney.

417
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,023
That would be a lie.

418
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,441
Yes.

419
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,110
But we aren't "stupposed"
to lie.

420
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,778
Don't think of it as lying.

421
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,323
Think of it as
high-stakes pretending.

422
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,491
Well, I'm not going to.

423
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,536
-Ah, just a little white lie.
-Nope.

424
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,789
Agnes, as your father,
I command you to lie.

425
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,540
No.

426
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,584
-Yes, lie.
-Mm-mm.

427
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,670
You are walking on thin ice,
little lady.

428
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,546
Hmph.

429
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,467
Why can't you be more like
your sister Edith?

430
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,344
She lies all the time.

431
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,471
-No, I don't.
-See? See?

432
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,181
She's lying right now.

433
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,432
Beautifully, I might add.

434
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,767
Okay, you guys.

435
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,643
This is our first big day
in Mayflower,

436
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,146
and I say we make it
a great one.

437
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,773
Right, Chet Jr.?

438
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,399
Woo-hoo! Mayflower!

439
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,193
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

440
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,736
We're gonna be late for karate.

441
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,488
-And you have to get Margo
to school. -Ah.

442
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,281
It's gonna be awesome.

443
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,783
-Yay.
-Hey.

444
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,244
You just have to put yourself
out there, and I promise,

445
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,538
Mayflower will love
Chet Cunningham.

446
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,916
Well, they're gonna love him
just as much as I do.

447
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,292
Mm.

448
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,668
And you, little man,
are gonna have

449
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,420
so much fun
with your daddy today.

450
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,300
Yep, just you and Dada.

451
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,302
Come on, say it. "Dada."

452
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,638
"Dada."

453
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,102
Gonna be a fun day.

454
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,372
Okay.

455
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,170
Thanks a lot, guys.

456
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,510
All right.

457
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,470
-Thanks, hon. Bye.
-Bye.

458
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,140
Look, Margo. Neighbors.

459
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,891
Hello!

460
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,184
Hmm?

461
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,310
Come on.

462
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,146
You got this, Chet.

463
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,151
I'm your new neighbor,
Chet Cunningham.

464
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,735
Uh-huh. Perry Prescott.

465
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:10,198
So, what, uh, brings you
to the neighborhood, Chet?

466
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,617
Well, uh...

467
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,494
Solar panels.

468
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,539
That's it. I sell solar panels.

469
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,250
Have you joined
the solar revolution?

470
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,085
Yeah, no.

471
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,087
Uh, I think I'm good.

472
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,255
Good to know.

473
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,090
So, uh, what do you do, Perry?

474
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,800
I own Prescott Motors,

475
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:32,512
the largest auto dealer
in the state.

476
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,140
Wow. That's impressive.

477
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,184
This is my daughter Margo.

478
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,393
Bree, Dad.

479
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,270
Ah, yes.

480
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,938
Yes. Did I say "Margo"?

481
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,357
It's funny because
I was thinking...

482
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,775
I was thinking about a fish

483
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,944
I once had as a pet named Margo,

484
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,407
who lived in the pond
and, uh, then died.

485
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,912
Anyway, I, uh...

486
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:00,749
I am about to take Bree
to school for her first day.

487
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,127
Yeah, I was about to take Poppy
to school, so...

488
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,213
Poppy. Hello, Poppy.

489
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,256
That's a fun name to say.

490
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,091
You want to carpool with us?

491
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,551
No.

492
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,512
You can be friends with Bree.

493
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,804
Right, Bree?

494
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,349
You don't have any friends.

495
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,938
Well, love the chitchat, Chet,
but she's got school,

496
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,857
and I'm meeting some pals
over at the country club, so...

497
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,859
Ooh, country club.
That sounds like a lot of fun.

498
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,195
If I were ever invited
to a country club,

499
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:34,574
I am sure
that I would love it.

500
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,661
Yeah, well, we really
have to get going,

501
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,162
so nice meeting you, Chet.

502
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,997
♪ I'm too sexy... ♪

503
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,541
Okay, cool.

504
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:46,628
Anytime you want to hang out,
just hit me up with a text.

505
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,588
He's gonna text me.

506
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,715
That was painful.

507
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,931
You'll see, by lunchtime,
you will have forgotten

508
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,684
all about your old,
lousy friends.

509
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,562
Mm, not so sure about that.

510
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,365
Hey, honey, you got this.

511
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,534
You are smart. You are funny.

512
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,578
What's there to worry about,
right?

513
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,163
They're gonna love you.

514
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,958
Thanks, Gru.

515
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,169
Buh-bye.

516
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,215
Oh, please let them love you.

517
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,097
Hey, Poppy.

518
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,020
Uh...

519
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,732
Move it!

520
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,400
Sorry. My bad.

521
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,862
I'm going. All right, I'm going.

522
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,990
Ooh. Glassos.

523
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,896
All right, gentlemen, fall in.

524
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,775
Some of you may be wondering
why you're here.

525
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,610
-Uh...
-Si.

526
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,612
As you may or may not know,

527
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,155
I was recently called out
of retirement

528
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,325
to head up the AVL's
new top secret initiative

529
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,702
to take down Maxime Le Mal.

530
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,621
And that's where you come in.

531
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,289
We need volunteers.

532
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,502
We are looking for the strong,
the mighty...

533
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,753
-Oh.
-Uh...

534
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,088
-...the fearless.
-Uh, nope.

535
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,799
-We need the best of the best.
-Uh...

536
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,802
So, who's it going to be?

537
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,931
Yes, nice work, gentlemen.

538
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,141
Uh, blumach.

539
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,019
The AVL is known

540
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,313
for cutting-edge weapons
and vehicles,

541
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,358
but now we are developing
cutting-edge agents,

542
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,654
and I can think of no better
guinea pigs than you.

543
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,280
Guinea pig! Yeah!

544
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,743
You will be the first
to test our Super-serum,

545
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,246
designed to transform you
into elite agents

546
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:31,042
with powers and abilities
far beyond those of mortal man.

547
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,629
Or you might just explode.

548
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,423
We don't really know.

549
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:37,757
Uh, uh, huh?

550
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,179
Ah...

551
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:22,135
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Mega Minions.

552
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,853
Cool!

553
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,063
Aw, you guys look adorable.

554
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,191
And-and really tough
and-and scary.

555
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,568
I'll look even better
when I have a black belt.

556
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,069
Hi-yah!

557
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,906
Ooh, ooh! I'm gonna break
a brick with my head.

558
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,116
That's the spirit. Oh!

559
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,578
Oh, okay, now, go have fun
while I'm at work.

560
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,581
Blair and Britney, right?

561
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,291
-Mm...
-We will!

562
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,084
Okay. Bye, Mom.

563
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,544
Bye!

564
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,670
Gotcha.

565
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,422
Hi-yah!

566
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,174
Circle up, people.

567
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,054
Show respect for your sensei.

568
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,265
Yes, Sensei O'Sullivan!

569
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,059
Hai!

570
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:17,857
You, Moscovitch, didn't I
tell you to cut that hair?

571
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,609
You look like a sheepdog.

572
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,027
Sorry, Sensei.

573
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,572
Now, we have
two new students today

574
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:29,619
ready to begin their journey--
hi-yah!-- to awesomeness.

575
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,955
You, tiny girl.

576
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,332
Step forward
and tell us your name.

577
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,875
Um...

578
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,169
It's Britney.

579
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,671
Uh...

580
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,965
m-my name?

581
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,968
I can't...

582
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,637
There's no "can't" in karate.

583
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,014
Ten push-ups after class!

584
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,975
Hey, that's not fair.

585
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,813
You better not be talking back
to your sensei.

586
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:02,318
Now, are you ready to tell us
your name and participate?

587
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,320
Mm...

588
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,989
I guess not.

589
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,991
Then why don't you go sit

590
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,410
in the corner
of disgrace and reflection

591
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,454
and think about what kind
of person you want to be?

592
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:22,338
Now, am I gonna get
any trouble from you?

593
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,048
Yeah, probably.

594
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,383
Excuse me?

595
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,052
If you think I'm above
fighting children,

596
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,972
you picked the wrong dojo.

597
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,574
That was for my sister.

598
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,496
You broke my pinkie toe.

599
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,876
That's gonna be
a lot of push-ups.

600
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,212
Okay, put this over here.

601
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,339
Hair gel.

602
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,840
-Hairspray.
-Oh, uh, Mrs. Cunningham.

603
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,884
Oh, yeah, uh, yeah? Uh, um, hi.

604
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,887
I have to say,
this is quite a résumé.

605
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,805
Well, what can I say?

606
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,223
I'm good at what I do.

607
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,226
Well, you are exactly
what we need here.

608
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,729
Lot of vain, demanding divas
in this town.

609
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,943
I have a hair emergency, people.

610
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:28,738
Where's what's-her-name?
Remy? Rhonda?

611
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,615
Oh, Melora, I'm so sorry.

612
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,991
Rachel's on maternity leave.

613
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,577
What?! Oh, that is unacceptable.

614
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:39,749
But you are in luck, because
Blanche here is fantastic.

615
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,126
Perfect. I'll be in my chair.

616
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,004
Okay, kiddo, you're up.

♪ Let's go! ♪

618
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:52,595
So, Melora,
what are we thinking?

619
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,640
What if we just wet the hair
and let it dry in the air?

620
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,226
Let nature do
its "thang," you know?

621
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,937
No, no, no, no,
that style is dead to me.

622
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,731
It's-it's time for
a whole new Melora.

623
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,900
I want this.

624
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,777
Wow.

625
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,154
Wow. Um...

626
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:14,117
Okay. Let's start with color.

627
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,995
Yes, color, 'cause that's
what you start with.

628
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,832
A little of this.

629
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,625
Some of that.

630
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,043
And, ooh, that's pretty.

631
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,712
This isn't so hard.

632
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,549
Uh...

633
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,346
What?

634
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,474
Should it be smoking?

635
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,767
Yes, uh-huh.

636
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,602
Smoking means it's working.

637
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,195
What's going on?

638
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,281
Perfect. No one panic.

639
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,575
Call 911!

640
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,707
Quickly, quickly.

641
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,792
Oh.

642
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,544
Wonder where they're going.

643
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,716
Voilà.

644
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,384
My latest creation.

645
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,971
All of my transformation powers
in a handheld design, huh?

646
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,473
Ay, I love it.

647
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,558
Oh, and look at
the little antenna.

648
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,559
That's so cute.

649
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,561
It's not supposed
to be cute, no!

650
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,606
I'm going for intimidating.
Terrifying, even.

651
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:31,027
Now, all I have to do is find
that walking bald potato,

652
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,362
and his baby is mine.

653
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,531
Check this out.

654
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,964
No, I kid you not. I'm being...

655

Whoa!

656
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,219
Whoa!

657
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,152
Oh, this is going to be so good!

658
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,750
Okay, Daddy is
officially exhausted.

659
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,127
I changed your diaper.

660
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,003
I've got your bottle,
your Binky.

661
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,214
And here are your balloons.

662
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,590
There you go.

663
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,509
You like those, right?

664
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,928
All right,
a little bit of me time.

665
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,408
Mmm, mmm.

666
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,964
Someone put a glitter bomb
in my locker.

667
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,633
Ugh, teenagers are the worst.

668
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,971
Yeah, babies are no picnic,
either.

669
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,314

670
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,995
Ah, okay, okay.

Hello. Wha... Hey.

What. What the...

00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,949
Oh. Hello, Poppy.

680
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,283
Did you say something?

681
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,078
Wha... My name's Chet,
by the way.

682
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,704
Chet Cunningham.

00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,956
Gru?

Wha...
What does that even mean?

685
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,171
It means you're bad at lying.

686
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,714
Hey, that's not nice.

687
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,217
Ever hear of respecting
your elders?

688
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,219
I don't respect boomers.

689
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,762
I just mock them.

690
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,016
Is that, like, a joke
you read on the Web?

691
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,227
Wow. "The Web"?

692
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,895
How old are you?

693
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,773
Well, old enough to know
that you are a rotten little...

694
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,152
You better watch yourself.

695
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,570
Ooh.

696
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,240
You used to be a master villain.

697
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,450
That's not me.

698
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,411
I don't even see a resemblance.

699
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,205
Clearly, you have the wrong guy,

700
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,417
as I sell... mm, solar panels.

701
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,836
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not gonna expose you.

702
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,171
Because you're gonna help me
pull a heist.

703
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,090
We start planning tomorrow.

704
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,758
You want to pull a heist?

705
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,428
Listen, kid, I'm not going to...

706
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,014
-No, you listen, old man.
-Ow.

707
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,849
I own you.

708
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:34,312
And I promise,
you do not want to cross me.

709
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,980
Okay.

710
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,817
All right, but tomorrow
is-is not really good timing.

711
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,152
Bummer for you.

712
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,154
Because this is happening,

713
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:49,327

to know exactly who you are...

00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,497
...Gru.

715
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,877

Oh, blumach.

723
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,869
Hey, Jiminy! Tu cafe le colda?
No problemo.

724
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,102
Thank you.

725
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,564
All right, all right,
s-settle down.

726
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,358
Settle down!

727
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,984
Thank you.

728
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,237
It's time to get you out
for some real-world training.

729
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,783
And if you do well out there,

730
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:14,245
you'll be the AVL's
new secret weapon.

731
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,538
Pomodoro!

732
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,927
I'm quite sure
I won't regret this.

733
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,347
No, the painters canceled.

734
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,765
-Uh-huh.
-True story.

735
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,475
-Wow. -I don't know what is
the deal with these...

736
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,935
-Morning, neighbors!
-Uh...

737
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,437
Hey there!

738
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,106
Still waiting on that invite,
Perry.

739
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,441
-Uh...
-Oh!

740
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,526
-No. No. No, no.
-Yoo-hoo!

741
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,236
-Patsy.
-Oh, neighbors.

742
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,238
-Oh, Patsy.
-Hi there.

743
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,282
I'm Perry's wife Patsy.

744
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,491
Oh. I'm Blanche.

745
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,118
And this is Chet.

746
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,621
Hi. So I look over here,
and I see you, and...

747
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,790
I have one of
my brilliant ideas.

748
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,918
Perry needs a fourth
for tennis tomorrow.

749
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,295
Oh, honey.

750
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,880
I... I don't know.

751
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,466
He doesn't seem like
much of a tennis guy.

752
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,758
Much of a tennis guy?

753
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,510
I am too much of a tennis guy.

754
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,471
I'm Mr. Tennis.

755
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,682
It's my favorite
of all the sports games.

756
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,685
With the racket and, uh,
with the balls.

757
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,812
So yellow and fuzzy.

758
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,856
Oh, then we're all set.

759
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,608
See you two at the club
tomorrow.

760
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,651
Toodle-oo.

761
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,070
Okay. Toodle-oo to you two, too.

762
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,491
So, you-you play tennis?

763
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,410
Yes, yes, I play tennis.

764
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,746
I'm pretty fantastic, actually.

765
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,123
Well, at least I was
at summer camp.

766
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,291
Wow, that's great.

767
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,584
Here you go.

768
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,377
Mwah. Okay, bye.

769
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:48,005
Have fun.

770
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,674
There you go.

771
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,302
Okay.

772
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,638
Huh?

773
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,730
What the...

774
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,288
Gru.

775
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,165
You can't hide from me, Gru.

776
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,834
Ay, my back is killing me.

777
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,795
How long is this gonna take?

778
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,464
It will take
as long as it takes.

779
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,175
Mark my words, Gru will not win.

780
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,303
This won't be like
the ninth grade talent show.

781
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,597
Ay, again with this.

782
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,267
Yes, again.
It was a pivotal moment.

783
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,143
Why can't you indulge me?

784
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,231
It was the night
of the big show.

785
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,026
I had practiced for weeks,

786
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,655
perfecting a number that would
blow my classmates away.

787
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,366
♪ Karma, karma, karma, karma,
karma chameleon... ♪

788
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,493
I was about to go on when...

789
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,953
-What?
-I heard it.

790
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,080
Wait. Oh.

791
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:08,627
♪ Karma, karma, karma, karma,
karma chameleon... ♪

792
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,463
There was that little jerk

793
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,048
doing my big number.

794
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,801
♪ You come and go... ♪

795
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,429
He ruined everything.

796
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,638
I couldn't go on after him.

797
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,473
I would've looked like a fool.

798
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,434
Like I was copying him.

799
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,686
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

800
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,646
That was a very popular song.

801
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,565
Oh, no, no, no, no. He knew.

802
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,442
He did it on purpose.

803
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,360
He reveled in humiliating me.

804
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,945
Huh?

805
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,615
-What now?
-Ugh, we're low on fuel.

806
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,325
It's always something.

807
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,369
Look, I can never focus
on just being evil.

808
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,204
Okay.

809
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,081
Pull over.

810
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,278
Okay, let's see.

811
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,197
Regular unleaded.

812
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,365
Ooh. Wow.

813
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,908
It is expensive, no?

814
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,703
Okay. Insert card
and remove rapidly.

815
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,872
"Card not read."

816
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,293
-Oh, come on.
-Did you pull it out rapidly?

817
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,712
Yes, yes, very rapidly.

818
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,264
Ay, get me a slushy.
It's my cheat day.

819
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,395
Hey, you, your stupid machine
won't read my card.

820
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,313
Did you remove it rapidly?

821
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,481
Yes.

822
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,733
Well, sometimes it's too rapid.

823
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,860
You should probably try again.

824
00:44:56,902 --> 00:45:00,155
I don't have time for this!

825
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,782
Whoa!

826
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:05,911
I'm trying to destroy
my archnemesis.

827
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,039
Now, give me 900 gallons
on pump four, you idiot.

828
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,750
Please don't hurt me.

829
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,877
Oh, I'm not going to hurt you.

830
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,381
Wha...

831
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,092
Ow!

832
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,973
Oh, look at you.

833
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,559
Much better.

834
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,477
Now, get me a purple slushy!

835
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,398
I'm not paying for that,
just so you know.

836
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,733
So there.

837
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,984
I know I'm so bad.

838
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:46,702
Hmm. Okay, why don't you guys
pick out a healthy cereal?

839
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,372
This was Lucky's
favorite cereal.

840
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:54,334
You don't think
he'll forget me, do you?

841
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:57,296
Oh, sweetheart,
that's impossible.

842
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,048
You play with Lucky
and-and dress him up.

843
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,134
And you guys have your podcast.

844
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,888
There is no way in this world
he could ever forget

845
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,182
his best friend.

846
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,184
Thanks, Mom.

847
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,602
Oh, look it!

848
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,563
This one has extra marshmallows!

849
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,106
Double Frosted Choco Clusters.

850
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,776
-Yeah.
-Yeah, let's go with those.

851
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,569
All right, what else do we need?

852
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,239
Oh, no.

853
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,950
Nobody see. Nobody notice.
Nobody notice.

854
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,538
-Whew.
-What's wrong?

855
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,831
Huh?

856
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,792
Oh, nothing. Just, uh...

857
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,628
ooh, stretching
before we hit the aisles.

858
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:41,006
Shopping is the number one
cause of pulled hamstrings.

859
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,050
Probably didn't know that.

860
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,138
Okay, all stretched.
Let's go. Quickly.

861
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,848
Quick, quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick.

862
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,350
Okay. Coast is clear.

863
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:55,813
Uh... oh.

864
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,774
You!

865
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,361
You did this to me!

866
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,487
You fraud.

867
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,322
Come on, girls.
Clean up on aisle nine!

868
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,449
I've always wanted to say that.

869
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,535
Just hide over here.

870
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,912
What does that lady want?

871
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,872
Lady? I didn't see a lady.

872
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,126
Lady!

873
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,711
Come on, let's go.

874
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,630
-Faster.
-Aah! -Whoa!

875
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,257
You're no hairdresser!

876
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:26,134
I'm onto you!

877
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,554
-Get back here!
-Got to get out of here.

878
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,281
Okay.

879
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:54,872
Come back here!

880
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,000
Whoa!

881
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,505
Hey! No, no, no, no, no!

882
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,674
-You can't just...
-Open! Open!

883
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,342
Open!

884
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,434
Whoa!

885
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,768
Let's go.

886
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:23,483
Stop! Come here, you!

887
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,779
No!

888
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,031
Whew.

889
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,532
That was a close one.

890
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,076
Always a fun time
when you go shopping with Mom.

891
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,912
-Yeah!
-Best shopping trip ever!

892
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,372
I feel so alive!

893
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,197
Perfecto.

894
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,115
Poppy?

895
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,785
Poppy!

896
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,790
I don't see her, Junior.

897
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,249
Look up, genius.

898
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,876
-Huh?
-You're late.

899
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,213
How do I get up there?

900
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,798
Use the trampoline.

901
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,341
Huh?

902
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,056
Here we go.

903
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,649
Whoa! Aah!

904
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,196
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

905
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,793
It is I,

906
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,129
Poppy Prescott,

907
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,548
villainess.

908
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,008
Have a seat, Gru.

909
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,051
All right, I'll sit...

910
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,430
Okay. Why am I here?

911
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:21,101
Because, like you,
I was born to be bad.

912
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,519
And now...

913
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:26,189
it's time to discuss
our big heist.

914
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,816
"Heist."

915
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,609
Please, you're just a child.

916
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,739
All great villains start young.

917
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,867
Didn't you steal the
Crown Jewels when you were 12?

918
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,494
I was a lot younger than that.

919
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,413
And no offense,
but you're not me.

920
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:45,542
Oh, I plan on being
a lot better than you.

921
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,003
Check this out.

922
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,464
Hey, is that my old school?

923
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,049
Bingo.

924
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:56,094
Which I have expertly modeled
with glue and Popsicle sticks.

925
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,097
And it's where
we are going to steal...

926
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,725
the school mascot.

927
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,769
You want to steal Lenny?

928
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,103
Exactly.

929
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,939
Lycee Pas Bon has always been
my dream school,

930
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,357
and this heist
will look so great

931
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,276
on my villain transcripts.

932
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,236
That is a terrible idea.

933
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:16,281
Have you ever even seen
a honey badger?

934
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,617
They are vicious
little monsters.

935
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:22,704
They literally eat bees
and cobras for breakfast.

936
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,998
Honey badger don't care.

937
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,250
No way. No way am I helping you.

938
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,711
Well, that's the thing
with blackmail.

939
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,589
You kind of have no choice.

940
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,064
Come here. Come here!

941
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,291
Ah, uh...
Tim.

942
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,918
Tim, uh, tu le do it.

943
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,170
-Go, go, go.
-P-P-Porque meo?

944
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,549
Chihuahua.

945
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,098
Bas enough!

946
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,100
No! Tu le stronga.

947
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,685
Tu le forta.

948
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:27,894
Tu le besta!

949
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,272
Les salami!

950
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,107
Les salami!

951
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,734
Aah! Suppository!

952
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,117
Hey! Police!

953
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,785
No problemo.

954
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,170
Ooh. Uh...

955
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,630
Piña colada.

956
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,263
Help!

957
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,475
Please, can you help me?

958
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,644
Oh, si, si.

959
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,944
Hey. All is goot.

960
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,112
Ciao!

961
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,825
Smudge, Smudge, come down.

962
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,327
Hey!

963
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,583
Les gato.

964
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,793
Thank you. Thank you.

965
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,796
Ooh, smoocha.

966
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,674
Oh!

967
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,227
Help!

968
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,938
Bazooka!

969
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,790
Ah. Uh...

970
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,172
Hey, hey. Stoppa. Stoppa.

971
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,840
Muy risky. Lemme do it.

972
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,769
Ciao, bellos!

973
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,651
There they are.
Those guys crushed my car.

974
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,444
They destroyed the coffee shop!

975
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,696
Yeah, get out of here!

976
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,239
They're ruining everything.

977
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,824
I'm sick of superheroes.

978
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,409
-Yeah.
-Let's get 'em.

979
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,998
Get in.

980
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,045
Gentlemen...

981
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,423
our experiment has failed.

982
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,342
You are officially
going to be retired.

983
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,303
Yeah! Retirement!

984
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,638
Uh, uh, no?

985
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,780
Whoa. There it is.

986
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,122
The castle.

987
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,540
The gargoyles.

988
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,917
I can't believe I'm
really here.

989
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,176
Okay.

990
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,679
Voilà.

991
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,806
Okay, let's get this over with.

992
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,476
-Ron, hand me my gear.
-Voilà.

993
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,519
-Keep a close eye on him.
-Okay.

994
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,021
If you need anything,
I brought formula...

995
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,398
-Uh-huh. Formula. Diapers.
-...extra diapers,

996
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,566
-his favorite Binky.
-Come on.

997
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,526
Let's go, let's go.

998
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:14,746
And now we cut
through the glass with my...

999
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,331
Diapers?

1000
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,499
What?

1001
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,917
You've got to be kidding
with me.

1002
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,214
Hey, guys. Guys.

1003
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,715
Guys? Guys.

1004
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:28,468
Guys, where is the other bag,
with my gear?

1005
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,261
Ah, in le balloon.

1006
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,013
Ah, uh...

1007
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,473
Oops.

1008
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,018
What? How...

1009
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:42,023
All right, all right.
Let's see what I got in here.

1010
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,566
Uh... come on.

1011
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,235
Come on, come on, come on.

1012
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,903
Aha.

1013
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,619
Thank you.

1014
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,082
Easy peasy.

1015
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,886
Huh?

1016
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,436
That's Mr. Friendly.

1017
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,066
No, no, no, no, no!

1018
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,033
Whew.

1019
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,085
Ha, ha, ha.

1020
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,009
That's Dr. Destructo.

1021
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,635
He was just a kid.

1022
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:55,138
And there's Killer Driller's
original helmet.

1023
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,682
Come on. Stay focused.

1024
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,193
Diaper.

1025
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,709
I need something like...

1026
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,253
-something that I can...
-How about this?

1027
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,005
Nice.

1028
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,843
Yes!

1029
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,306
We're in.

1030
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,474
Wait.

1031
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,142
No, no, no, no, no.

1032
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,477
Baby powder.

1033
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,562
Ah, si, si. Yeah.

1034
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,693
Whoa.

1035
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,112
You know, the most important
part of a heist

1036
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,782
is being constantly aware
of potential danger.

1037
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,283
Le baby!

1038
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,327
La la! Tiramisu!

1039
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,995
No, no! Le baby! Komay le!

1040
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,664
No. Junior.

1041
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,332
Junior, come back here.

1042
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:09,337
So, what's your plan now?

1043
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,464
I am dealing with it.

1044
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,344
Don't touch anything.

1045
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:20,056
No. No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no!

1046
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,101
Good job, Junior.

1047
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:25,311
Way to go.

1048
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,691
Aw, he's having fun.

1049
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,442
Eh, too much fun.

1050
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,737
-Ah, stoppa.
-Blah, blah, blah.

1051
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:38,908
Please, Junior, Daddy needs
to steal a honey badger.

1052
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,122
Whew. Okay.

1053
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,458
I know they keep Lenny here
at night.

1054
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,669
And if memory serves,

1055
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:53,298
there is a hidden switch
around here somewhere.

1056
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:54,841
Ah. Aha.

1057
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,676
Yes.

1058
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,763
Ooh.

1059
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,190
I'll hit him with this.

1060
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:13,901
Once he's knocked out,
we'll open the cage.

1061
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,195
That fuzzy demon will sleep
like a baby the whole...

1062
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,495
Okay, he's still asleep.

1063
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:38,301
I tranked myself.

1064
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,510
Ow!

1065
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,225
Hey! Hey!

1066
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,688
Gru, what do we do?

1067
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,024
No!

1068
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,236
Oh, no!

1069
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,113
I ruined our heist.

1070
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:03,910
What? Who dares?

1071
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,501
Intruders!

1072
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,838
Intruders!

1073
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,102
Wake up!

1074
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,188
No!

1075
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,195
What?

1076
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,198
Hmm.

1077
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:46,619
Aw.

1078
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,995
Aw.

1079
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,748
No. Nope.

1080
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,753
Come on. We have to go.

1081
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:05,221
Intruders, you messed
with the wrong principal.

1082
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:08,057
Here we go.
Come on. Come on.

1083
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,815
Go, go, go!

1084
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,737
Come on! Come on!

1085
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:23,239
Ooh, you won't get away
with this.

1086
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,389
Prepare to feel the wrath
of Ubelschlecht.

1087
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:53,895
Diaper rash cream.

1088
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:57,231
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Stop, stop, stop.

1089
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,485
Oh, dear.

1090
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:04,614
Get back here, you!

1091
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:07,158
I want my Lenny!

1092
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,705
How are we getting out of here?

1093
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,582
Follow me.

1094
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,167
Get in.

1095
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,588
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1096
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,176
Mr. Friendly!

1097
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,720
Whoa!

1098
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,325
I have to say,

1099
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:53,579
that was, without a doubt,
the coolest night of my life.

1100
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:56,457
I can't believe
we actually pulled that off.

1101
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,127
Not gonna lie,
that was pretty fun.

1102
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:03,506
Scusa. Scusa.

1103
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:04,715
Thanks, Ron.

1104
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,050
Whew.

1105
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:10,847
And thank you for everything.

1106
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:13,015
Oh, and hey, don't worry.

1107
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:16,561
Your secret is safe with me,
partner.

1108
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:17,854
Thanks.

1109
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,897
Good night.

1110
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,777
Your dada did pretty good,
huh, Junior?

1111
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,913
Hello, Maxime.

1112
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,165
How's my favorite student?

1113
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,917
You know, I think you and I

1114
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,211
might be looking
for the same person,

1115
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:45,923
and I know exactly where he is.

1116
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,766
Thank you,
Principal Ubelschlecht.

1117
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:57,560
We got him!

1118
01:04:57,602 --> 01:05:00,062
Valentina, to Mayflower!

1119
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:01,856
With pleasure.

1120
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,614
Ah. Here we go.

1121
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,325
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1122
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,702
It's all coming back to me.

1123
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,372
Oops. Oh.

1124
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,832
Okay.

1125
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,792
See you later.

1126
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:22,960
Say, "Bye, Mommy and Daddy."

1127
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,378
Have fun at the club.

1128
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,631
Make good choices.

1129
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:28,674
-Bye, guys.
-Goodbye.

1130
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:29,884
Bye!

1131
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,552
Hey, Cunninghams.

1132
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,429
Um, hey, Poppy.

1133
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,222
I heard our parents
are having a playdate--

1134
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,058
which is adorable, by the way--

1135
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:39,894
and I thought you might
want to hang out.

1136
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,021
Oh. Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1137
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,815
Let's get this party started,
people!

1138
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,943
I like her.

1139
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:49,070
Yeah, most people do.

1140
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,238
Sweet.

1141
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,991
So, have you guys ever seen
a honey badger?

1142
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:04,335
Whoa, okay. These guys
aren't messing around.

1143
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,088
There are my favorite
new neighbors.

1144
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:10,132
-Hi.
-I'm loving this whole vibe.

1145
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:12,218
You two look like
a couple of pros.

1146
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,555
Yeah, but we're not.

1147
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:19,266
Perry and the boys are waiting
for y'all on the court,

1148
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,852
and we are hitting
the clubhouse.

1149
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:24,814
And you're telling me where
you got that to-die-for outfit.

1150
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:32,780
Over here, Chet.

1151
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,615
Hello.

1152
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,742
Okay.

1153
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,036
Skip, Chip, Chet.
Chet, Skip, Chip.

1154
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,246
Hey there, fellas.

1155
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:41,914
-Hello.
-How are you doing, Chet?

1156
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:42,999
Okay.

1157
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,878
Chet here is gonna show
us fellas how it's done.

1158
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,630
Right?

1159
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,174
Uh, hmm.

1160
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:55,761
Oh, I'm gonna smoke this guy.

1161
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,388
Okay.

1162
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,814
Huh?

1163
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,525
What the...

1164
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:18,075
Okay. Let's do this.

1165
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,582
Huh? You've got to be kidding.

1166
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,502
Okay, okay.

1167
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,046
Better?

1168
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:37,011
-What?
-Hmm?

1169
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,555
That doesn't count.

1170
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,348
And... oh! What?

1171
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,934
You can't just...

1172
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:45,436
This is ridiculous!

1173
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:48,314
Huh?

1174
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:53,861
Ah.

1175
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:02,578
Thanks, Ron.

1176
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,746
Hey, no! Oh, no!

1177
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:08,084
Come and get it.

1178
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,211
-Oh, it's so cute.
-Whoa.

1179
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,588
This is the weirdest dog ever.

1180
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,883
I'll get it.

1181
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,852
Well, hello, little one.

1182
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,604
Is your daddy home?

1183
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:32,399
Sorry. I'm not "stupposed"
to talk to strangers.

1184
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:35,277
Oh. I'm not a stranger.

1185
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:38,489
Well, you look strange to me.

1186
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,866
Who is it?

1187
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,409
I don't know.

1188
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:46,705
But she's old
and smells like pickles.

1189
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,503
Okay, I'm coming.

1190
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,174
Oh, no. Um...

1191
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:59,635
I'll be right back.

1192
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,013
Can I help you?

1193
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:04,890
Well, I hope so.

1194
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,309
I'm an old friend of Gru's.

1195
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,312
Well, he's not here, so...

1196
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:12,857
Oh, that's all right.

1197
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:15,401
I'll wait.

1198
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,030
Huh? What? No!

1199
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,951
Whenever you're ready, Perry.

1200
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,911
Um...

1201
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:27,496
Hmm?

1202
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:37,214
Needless to say, Perry and I
are no longer welcome

1203
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,091
on the island of O'ahu.

1204
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,260
True story.

1205
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,179
Honey.

1206
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:44,638
-Oh, thank goodness.
-It's the children.

1207
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,266
We have to go now.

1208
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,059
Oh.

1209
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,644
Thanks. Bye.

1210
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,438
-Our cover's blown.
-What?

1211
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,398
-Call Silas.
-Oh, no.

1212
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,509
♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪

1213
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,308
Ah.

1214
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,353
Gru's been compromised.

1215
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:34,271
This is an emergency, people.

1216
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,482
Retirement is officially over.

1217
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:39,401
Assemble the Mega Minions.

1218
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:49,536
Pomodoro!

1219
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,129
Pomodoro!

1220
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:07,596
Shooshta, shooshta,
shooshta, shooshta,

1221
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:10,015
shooshta, shooshta, shooshta!

1222
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,769
Hey.

1223
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,854
Bello, busy bee.

1224
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:17,648
Aw.

1225
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,151
Pomodoro!

1226
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:26,991
Yee-haw!

1227
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,743
Pomodoro!

1228
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:33,247
Pomodoro!

1229
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:34,957
Yee-haw!

1230
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,792
Yippa, yippa!

1231
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:40,170
Huh?

1232
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:41,922
Whoa.

1233
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,173
Yeah!

1234
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,926
Huh?

1235
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:56,979
So, your father
has been naughty.

1236
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:59,523
Very naughty.

1237
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:03,360
He took something of mine
that I desperately want back.

1238
01:12:08,115 --> 01:12:10,326
Principal Ubelschlecht?

1239
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:14,163
Ooh. I know you took my Lenny.

1240
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:15,956
-Now, hand him over!
-Ow!

1241
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,291
Ow. That...

1242
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,585
-Actually very funny story.
-Zip it!

1243
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:21,170
I don't want to hear
your excuses.

1244
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:22,421
I'm here to teach you a lesson.

1245
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,964
Let's go, tough guy.

1246
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,299
Okay.

1247
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,259
I'm not going to fight
an old lady.

1248
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:28,594
Oh, yeah?

1249
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:30,137
Well, I'm gonna give you
a whupping

1250
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:31,805
for the history books.

1251
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,307
Whoa, whoa!

1252
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,394
Take that!

1253
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:43,442
Yeah, go!

1254
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,611
Girls, look out! Over here!

1255
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:47,279
-Everyone, get down!
-Gru!

1256
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:51,200
Hey, back off, lady.

1257
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,796
Stop it!

1258
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:04,838
Let him go!

1259
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,924
Take that!

1260
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,392
Now we have to get in there

1261
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:17,726
and find that baby.

1262
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:19,436
What?

1263
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,358
Oh! Jackpot, huh?

1264
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,776
Ay, Maxime.

1265
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,486
This is too easy.

1266
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:30,322
Come here, little baby.

1267
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:31,573
Come to Maxime.

1268
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:33,700
Yes. Coochie-coochie...

1269
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,619
-Oh!
-Ay, Maxime.

1270
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,371
You little...

1271
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,915
You are in big trouble.

1272
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,668
Gotcha!

1273
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,595
Whew.

1274
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:55,389
Wait. Where's the baby?

1275
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,808
Where's the baby?!

1276
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,059
Junior?

1277
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:04,231
Lucy!

1278
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,399
Go after the baby.

1279
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:09,361
Maxime.

1280
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,321
Say au revoir, Gru.

1281
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:12,739
Oh, and don't worry.

1282
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:15,451
He will be very happy
with his new daddy.

1283
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:16,869
Right? Look at him.

1284
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:19,329
Oh, he loves his new daddy.

1285
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:21,081
Junior!

1286
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,793
No!

1287
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,338
Whoa!

1288
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,840
Get in.

1289
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:32,885
We've got a baby to save.

1290
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:42,144
We got him!

1291
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:45,647
Oh, who is ready to become
a little roach?

1292
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:47,649
Ow! Let go!

1293
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:49,443
Ow! Those are very sensitive.

1294
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,570
Aah! You squirmy little...

1295
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:52,821
Oh!

1296
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:55,657
Ugh! Are you kidding me?

1297
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:58,327
You got pee-pee
all over my ship.

1298
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,540
Valentina, bring me
the Roachification Ray.

1299
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,587
There they are.

1300
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:12,424
I'm on it.

1301
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,885
Here we go!

1302
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:23,227
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1303
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,193
What's that?

1304
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:33,362
Hello.

1305
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:35,280
Gru!

1306
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:37,616
Get me closer.

1307
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:41,161
Almost there.

1308
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:44,706
Take them out!

1309
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:57,928
You're doing great!

1310
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,602
Go get 'em, partner.

1311
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,037
Ay! I can't see!

1312
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:41,346
Junior.

1313
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:44,057
Don't worry, Gru.

1314
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,684
The baby is fine.

1315
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:47,394
See for yourself.

1316
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,608
Oh, Junior.

1317
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:54,443
And now he belongs to me.

1318
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:56,528
Isn't that right, Maxime Jr.?

1319
01:16:58,071 --> 01:17:00,907
Together, we will wreak havoc,
cause mayhem

1320
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:03,243
and have so much fun
doing it, huh?

1321
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:07,623
And best of all, he hates you!

1322
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:09,207
He really does.

1323
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:11,335
Let my son go.

1324
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:12,836
No, I don't think so.

1325
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:16,256
The fun is just about
to start, huh?

1326
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:28,602
Oh, look at what a coward
your old daddy is, huh?

1327
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:57,756
You crossed the line, Maxime.

1328
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,591
Now, give me my son.

1329
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:03,136
I told you, he is my son now.

1330
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:15,691
Watch your step, Gru.

1331
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:17,234
It's a doozy!

1332
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,195
Too bad you can't fly, huh?

1333
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:28,537
-Let go!
-Ow!

1334
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,967
This ends now!

1335
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:43,844
Say goodbye to Daddy.

1336
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:52,561
It's okay, Junior.

1337
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:55,105
Dada loves you.

1338
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:20,297
Get back here.

1339
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:21,548
Bad baby.

1340
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,799
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

1341
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,301
Get off me, you demon!

1342
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:26,636
You are going to feel
the wrath of...

1343
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:39,691
Whoa.

1344
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:52,704
See? Not a scratch.

1345
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:54,706
Huh? Wha...?

1346
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:57,501
Salami!

1347
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:00,921
Pastrami!

1348
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:04,925
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1349
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:07,135
Prosciutto!

1350
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:09,763
-What?
-Prosciutto!

1351
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,598
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

1352
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,641
Gross.

1353
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:18,939
Nice try. When I...

1354
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:24,611
Antipasti.

1355
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:29,032
Oh!

1356
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:32,869
-Gru! -Oh, Gru!
-You're here!

1357
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:35,413
Junior!

1358
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,751
Yes!

1359
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:41,127
-Yay!
-Holy cow!

1360
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,796
-Are you guys okay?
-That was insane!

1361
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:49,469
Dada.

1362
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,350
Aw.

1363
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,394
Aw. My boys.

1364
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:58,979
Dada.

1365
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,106
You know something,
today has been

1366
01:21:01,147 --> 01:21:04,234
a real roller coaster
of emotion.

1367
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:09,656
Uh, Gru?

1368
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,908
Can we go back home now?

1369
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,331
All right. There you go.

1370
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,667
Yay!

1371
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,002
Thanks, Dr. Nefario.

1372
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:24,004
Good as new.

1373
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:26,923
No job too small or too mad.

1374
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:29,593
Bye, then.

1375
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:31,386
Bye.

1376
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,937
Hey. You okay, sweetie?

1377
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:43,899
Agnes!

1378
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,318
Someone's here to see you!

1379
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,368
Lucky?

1380
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:00,790
Lucky!

1381
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:05,712
Did you practice your tricks?

1382
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,673
Okay, play dead.

1383
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:14,888
Yay!

1384
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,390
Ah, that was... disturbing.

1385
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,059
-Yeah, little bit.
-Lucky!

1386
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:24,648
Hey, I'll, uh...
I'll be back soon.

1387
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:26,066
-Oh. Okay.
-Mwah.

1388
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:28,318
There's something
I need to take care of.

1389
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,611
Mwah.

1390
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:30,779
See you later, buddy.

1391
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,030
Love you, honey.

1392
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:34,491
Da-da-da.

1393
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:42,332
How you doing, Maxime?

1394
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:45,043
What are you doing here, Gru?

1395
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:46,711
You came to gloat, no?

1396
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:48,213
Gloat? No, no, no, no. I just...

1397
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:50,674
I wanted to get something
off my chest.

1398
01:22:50,715 --> 01:22:52,258
And it concerns

1399
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:55,011
the ninth grade talent show.

1400
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:58,932
Well, actually...

1401
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:02,435
-I did steal your song.
-What?

1402
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:03,687
I knew it!

1403
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:05,063
I knew there was no coincidence.

1404
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:06,648
You little liar!

1405
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,567
Well?

1406
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:10,944
Well, what?

1407
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,278
-Well, where's my apology?
-Apol...

1408
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,947
What are you talking about?

1409
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,782
I just apologized.

1410
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:17,117
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1411
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:18,910
No, that was no apology.

1412
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:21,079
You just wanted to rub it in.

1413
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:23,957
I can't believe
you stole my song.

1414
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,959
Hey, I only did that
to get back at you

1415
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,919
for pantsing me
at the homecoming dance.

1416
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:29,921
Besides,

1417
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:31,548
you could've gone on after me.

1418
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:34,843
It is not my fault
that you were afraid.

1419
01:23:34,884 --> 01:23:37,762
Afraid because I killed it!

1420
01:23:37,804 --> 01:23:39,264
Afraid? Ha!

1421
01:23:39,305 --> 01:23:41,725
I could outsing you
any day of the week

1422
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:43,309
and all day Sunday.

1423
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,979
I'd like to see that.

1424
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,148
Anytime, anyplace.

1425
01:23:48,231 --> 01:23:50,316
