1
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:04,160
Are you alright?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,860
You need to question
everyone around you.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,569
I'm so sorry

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,130
for what happened to Flora.

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,300
It was an accident.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,910
Will you tell him to
stop sending cards.

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,799
The incident
involving Linda Grey,

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,169
someone appears to have
been tracking her movements.

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,810
And it doesn't
look like Pepperstone.

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,130
Potentially your
work is the common factor.

11
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,870
When did Linda die?

12
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,669
It was the
3rd of October.

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,050
same as Flora's birthday.

14
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,959
I did receive a
postcard like that last week.

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,220
Peter it's Ingrid.

16
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,711
Ingrid.

17
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,049
They're saying they
need to talk to me.

18
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,260
You need to ask for a lawyer.

19
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,340
Why? What's going on?

20
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,451
Ingrid?

21
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,610
Why did you really
follow me here?

22
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,950
You don't think I have anything
to do with this, do you?

23
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,120
Mr Orpen, Ms Lewis. We really
need to get you to the station.

24
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:02,777
Dee?

25
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,551
Ingrid?

26
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,451
Okay.

27
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,120
Why did you go there, then?

28
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,100
I thought Peter might know something
about what's been going on.

29
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,669
Because you both received
the same postcard.

30
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,003
Hmm.

31
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,330
And Mark Orpen, your ex-fiance.

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,190
Why was he there?

33
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,740
He says he was following me.

34
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,360
Following you?

35
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,909
He was concerned for my safety.

36
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,770
Because of what happened
to Belinda Grey?

37
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,480
Because he knows John
Webster is back in my life.

38
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,139
Are you aware of any ill-will

39
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,539
Mr Orpen may have had
towards Belinda Grey

40
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,909
or Judge Stewart?

41
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,571
Mark.

42
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,641
No.

43
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,079
Are you treating
him as a suspect?

44
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,660
Do you have a reason
to think we should?

45
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,250
We obviously need to investigate
why he was at the crime scene.

46
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,449
If you'd listened
to me about Belinda

47
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,140
and when someone tried to kill me,
then Peter might still be alive.

48
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,960
I understand your frustration.

49
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,340
You were very helpful...

50
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,630
in providing a list of cases that
you'd worked on with Belinda Grey.

51
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,770
We're gonna need you to do
the same for Peter Stuart

52
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,279
And given that he was
previously Head of Chambers...

53
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,900
we must consider that your
Chambers may be the target.

54
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,442
Fuck.

55
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,680
Ah! You were
gone when I woke up.

56
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,010
Yeah, I went to the gym, I
needed to get my head straight.

57
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,540
Is that sensible with
everything going on?

58
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,620
Have you
heard from Mark?

59
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,560
He's still in custody.

60
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,070
The police think he
might be involved?

61
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,100
Did you
take these photos?

62
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,280
Is that legal?

63
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,469
Taking photos of a crime scene.

64
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,880
It's not illegal.

65
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,839
They can confiscate
them under Section 19

66
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,081
but they'd have to know I've
taken them, which they don't.

67
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,640
Did you get any sleep?

68
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,180
Talk to
me about that ring.

69
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,850
It was just one punch.

70
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:44,259
I don't deserve to have my
life ruined for that, right?

71
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,640
We've seen the
prosecution evidence.

72
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,080
But today is about hearing the
incident from your side, so...

73
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,510
why don't you talk
us through it?

74
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,481
Okay.

75
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,150
So, me and some friends
went to the pub and...

76
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,390
and this guy, He just
wouldn't leave us alone

77
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,770
wouldn't shut up.

78
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,450
And that would be Craig Nevins?

79
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,119
Yes. But I
didn't know his name then.

80
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,579
And had you met
Mr Nevins before?

81
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,241
No.

82
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,960
I asked him to stop

83
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:15,309
but he got aggressive.

84
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,939
He started mouthing off in my face
about how I pushed him at the bar

85
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,530
and how I had no right.

86
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,869
He got angry, started
squaring up to me.

87
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,700
So, I punched him.

88
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,110
And why would you do that?

89
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,520
To get him to back off.

90
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,230
Once.

91
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,620
The prosecution are going
to paint a picture of you

92
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,109
What we're going to do is

93
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,569
make sure what the jury
sees is not that one moment

94
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,910
that's being prosecuted,
but they get to see you.

95
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,880
The real you, the whole you.

96
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,060
That's my job.

97
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,011
Okay?

98
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,010
So talk to me about that ring.

99
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,950
Hey.

100
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,429
Tom's pulling together
that list of cases

101
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,829
for DI Winstanley, if you
can wait five minutes?

102
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,880
Yeah, no problem.

103
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,450
Thought you'd like to know that I've
been assigned to this now full time.

104
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:42,428
Has Mark been released?

105
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,419
Yes.

106
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,670
But we've advised him
not to leave London.

107
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,370
Just until we've made
some further inquiries.

108
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,730
You don't think he could
be involved in this, do you?

109
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,642
We are checking if
he has another bag.

110
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,450
For now I think it's best you don't
tell him where you're staying.

111
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,749
Could I talk to you outside?

112
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,500
Yeah.

113
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,049
Has the pathologist report
come back yet on Peter Stuart?

114
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:07,711
No.

115
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,289
I think I found something to do with
the injury on his hand. The ring.

116
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,239
Listen, this is
not a case for you.

117
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,390
This is our investigation.

118
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,639
The back of Peter's head, it
looked like blunt force trauma

119
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,180
But, what about his hand?

120
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,400
His finger is broken.

121
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,500
I really can't discuss
the case with you.

122
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,519
It looks like a defensive wound

123
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,230
but why would he have a defensive
wound if he was hit from behind.

124
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,709
I bet the cause of death come
back with traumatic brain injury

125
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,769
and they broke his finger
forcing a ring on post mortem.

126
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,880
Why would anyone do that?

127
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,480
To send a message to me.

128
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:46,500
Look, I've seen
this ring before.

129
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,920
The crown versus Oliver Gough.

130
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,200
Oliver Gough was my client.

131
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,830
He punched Mr Craig
Nevins in a pub.

132
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,770
Nevins hit his head,
subsequently died.

133
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,870
Another classy client of yours.

134
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,290
A lot of people
wear signet rings.

135
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,570
But this is the
identical family crest.

136
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,290
It was made for
Gough personally.

137
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:12,149
I asked him to take
it off for court

138
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,879
because juries don't tend to
respond well to posh boys.

139
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,769
But Belinda and I
worked on this together

140
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,380
and Judge Stuart heard the case.

141
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,749
Where is Gough
serving his sentence?

142
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,899
He pleaded guilty
to manslaughter.

143
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,910
Suspended sentence,
no prison time.

144
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:28,860
Where is he now?

145
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,569
From what I've been
able to piece together

146
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,899
he had a few dead end jobs and
then he just drops off the radar.

147
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,830
Completely.

148
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,110
Okay. I'll pass this
on to DI Winstanley.

149
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,080
Pass it on? Look,
we need to find him

150
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,310
now.

151
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,339
Two people are dead and
one of them turns up.

152
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,379
Wearing the ring on his finger.

153
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,180
Oliver Gough is connected
to this whole thing.

154
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,489
Ingrid, after everything
you've been through

155
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,219
over the last few days,
you just need to slow down.

156
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,229
Slow down? Sorry, how
many people need to die

157
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,909
before you start
taking me seriously?

158
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,609
We are taking you and this
case extremely seriously.

159
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,099
That is why I am going to
pass this on to DI Winstanley,

160
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,630
who is in charge of
the investigation.

161
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,980
I am still a target

162
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,907
Passing it along isn't
going to stop that.

163
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,780
You need to let us do
our job the right way

164
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,990
or you're going to get
yourself in a lot of trouble.

165
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,640
Gough. Oliver Gough.
I'm his barrister.

166
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,440
Three weeks?

167
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,720
No, I don't have time to
put a request in writing.

168
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:51,637
It's very important.

169
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,852
Please don't put
me on hold ag...

170
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,050
Hi, yeah, I understand it's not protocol,
but I'm just asking for your help.

171
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,150
Yeah. Okay, no, I get it.

172
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,701
Rules are rules.

173
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,500
Yeah. Okay.

174
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,700
Fuck!

175
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,580
What happened?

176
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,061
Sorry.

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,176
Sorry, I, erm...

178
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:41,566
Er.

179
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,252
I have to find Oliver Gough.

180
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,231
And I'm just hitting my
head against a brick wall.

181
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,030
You need to get some sleep
before you do something you regret.

182
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,600
You're not the police, you
can't do this on your own.

183
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:01,170
I know.

184
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,903
I know.

185
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,703
Hi, you okay?

186
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,180
Come on, Ing, what's up?

187
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,032
I keep seeing him.

188
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,040
Everywhere.

189
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,110
That's to be expected after
everything that happened.

190
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,390
Webster's gone.

191
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,280
He hasn't been in touch
for months, right?

192
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,590
Since just after the fire?

193
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,170
Do you know what
the weird thing is?

194
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,270
Before I knew where
he was all the time

195
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,550
and then he just disappeared.

196
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,890
And with him gone
it's actually worse.

197
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,350
I mean, it's...

198
00:13:58,806 --> 00:14:00,640
it's okay, I actually
wanted to see him.

199
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,850
How messed up is that?

200
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,490
I need your help.

201
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,040
I need you to do
something for me.

202
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,930
I need you to find someone
who doesn't want to be found.

203
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,989
He's not listed on
the electoral role.

204
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,650
Nothing on the Land Registry.

205
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,819
What about credit checks?

206
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,069
I checked Experian but
there's been no activity.

207
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,860
You posed as Gough.
I'm impressed.

208
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,390
Okay, here it is.

209
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,180
I, Oliver Gough, 22 Church
Crescent, Richmond, TW9 5NK,

210
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,380
British Nationality Act, 1981,

211
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,529
abandoned the name of
Oliver George Gough

212
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,510
and assumed the
name of Ollie Smith.

213
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,750
That's imaginative.

214
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,990
Changed his name.

215
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,070
What are you doing?

216
00:15:30,382 --> 00:15:32,480
John, what are you doing?
Who are you calling?

217
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,368
Hi, this is DS
Nash, Papa1570168.

218
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,480
Can you run a PNC
check for me, please?

219
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,734
Ollie Smith, likely an
alias of Oliver Gough.

220
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,000
Date of birth: 10th
of the first, 2001.

221
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,640
Do you have a last
known address?

222
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,670
Okay, thank you,
that's it. Thank you.

223
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,459
Did you get an address?

224
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:56,960
Hmm-hmm.

225
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:58,010
You didn't write it down.

226
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,280
I've got a good memory.

227
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:04,592
No.

228
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:06,120
Oliver Gough may be the killer.

229
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,040
Why? What's his motive?

230
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,049
That's the point.
You don't know.

231
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,919
You don't know anything about
his current state of mind.

232
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,969
That's why you need me with you.

233
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,399
Give me the address.
Just give me the address.

234
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,019
Ingrid, it's not weakness to
have someone who wants you back.

235
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,839
John, tell me where Gough is.

236
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,370
Either we go together
or not at all.

237
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,240
Why you doing this?

238
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,880
I know you're wary of me.

239
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,510
I can't believe
anything you say.

240
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,050
Because I think deep down
you know you need my help.

241
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,381
Ingrid.

242
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,280
It's alright.

243
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,690
It's alright.

244
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,070
Where are we?

245
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,731
We're here.

246
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,421
Where?

247
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,950
This is where
Oliver Gough lives.

248
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,420
Space number 12 back there.

249
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:21,884
It's DS Nash.

250
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,100
What the hell's he doing here?

251
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,710
He followed up.

252
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,420
Oh, yeah. Where's his back up?

253
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,060
Just stay in the car.

254
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,841
Why?

255
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,759
Because if he sees you with me

256
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,890
what little credibility
I have left will be gone.

257
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:37,957
Just get down.

258
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,731
Hi.

259
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,470
You understand that I have
the grounds to arrest you now.

260
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,749
This is obstruction
of a police officer

261
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,629
Oliver Gough is a
former client of mine

262
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,000
and it is perfectly
legal for me to meet him.

263
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,910
How'd you find him?

264
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,150
His parents gave me the address.

265
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,570
- Shall we go and see if he's home.
- No, we won't

266
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,451
He knows me. I
can actually help.

267
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:22,589
I don't know if you remember
this, but he killed someone.

268
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,120
Yeah, so maybe you shouldn't
be here without back up then.

269
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,429
And anyway, why would
he want to hurt me?

270
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,400
Belinda and I are the reason
he's not in prison right now.

271
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,830
Those kind of assumptions
can be very dangerous.

272
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,100
There's a pub about five
miles back down the M4.

273
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,259
It's called the Black Horse.

274
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,830
If you go there
I'll meet you after.

275
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,151
Okay.

276
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,390
This is John Webster.
Leave me a message. Thanks.

277
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,130
Oliver Gough.

278
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,880
We shouldn't go to trial
with the accident defence.

279
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,579
We're not.

280
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,479
And we're also not at work now.

281
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,340
Learn to switch it off
once in a while, Ing.

282
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,850
Listen, Gough is the
hero of the story.

283
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,239
That's quite a stretch.

284
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,360
Okay, fine, then
he's the victim.

285
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,209
That would mean doing a
real number of Craig Nevins.

286
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,365
Yeah, but just
because Nevins is dead

287
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:15,709
it doesn't suddenly
make him sane.

288
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,179
Gough doesn't deserve
to have his life ruined

289
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,560
for one error of judgement.

290
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,961
Don't you agree?

291
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,421
Hi.

292
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,860
Not guilty.

293
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,710
That was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

294
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,669
I know you were working for
me, but I didn't deserve it.

295
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,630
Yes, you did.

296
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,339
Everyone does.

297
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,001
No.

298
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,979
I didn't deserve to get off like
that, like nothing even happened.

299
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,530
You didn't get off. We
took the manslaughter plea.

300
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,869
And you carried
out your sentence

301
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,130
It was suspended.

302
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,959
I didn't have to do anything.

303
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,490
That's what a verdict is for.

304
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,760
So you know what it takes for
you to move on with your life.

305
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,350
It's worked out well, hasn't it?

306
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,200
I deserve to go to
prison for what I did.

307
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,040
After the trial, I
looked him up online.

308
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,570
And do you know what, Ingrid?

309
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,149
Craig Nevins was a good person.

310
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,530
You can't talk to yourself
like this, Oliver.

311
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,140
He had his whole
life ahead of him.

312
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,500
Then he went to have some
drinks with friends at the pub.

313
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,650
And I killed him.

314
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,990
You took away my one
chance to make amends.

315
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,070
Have you...

316
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,580
Have you had any contact...

317
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,240
with Judge Stuart
since the trial?

318
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,530
Your ring.

319
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,790
The one I had you take off
for court, do you remember?

320
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,751
I can't believe I used
to wear that thing.

321
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,379
It's like it was a different
person there that night.

322
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,480
What happened to it?

323
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,450
It was stolen.

324
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,320
Stolen?

325
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,990
My flat got broken into
a couple of months ago.

326
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,919
Was it just the
ring that was taken?

327
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,730
No.

328
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,340
The ring was with the
other stuff they took.

329
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,039
It was a dodgy building
in a shitty area.

330
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,120
Did the police follow up...

331
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,270
Did they catch anyone?

332
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,021
No.

333
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,210
I'm glad they took it though.

334
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,720
I was wearing it.
That night I...

335
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,310
I just want it to be over.

336
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,460
That's why I came here.

337
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,870
To get away.

338
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,690
To be safe.

339
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,360
Safe from who?

340
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,040
I didn't mean to... just now.

341
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,840
I've been working
on it, my anger.

342
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,400
Books.

343
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,899
And videos online.

344
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,709
It's okay.

345
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,540
Safe from who, Oliver?

346
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,210
I'll top you up.

347
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:54,931
Thank you.

348
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,300
There's something I
didn't show the detective.

349
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,321
What?

350
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,659
I didn't want you to get in trouble,
you were just doing your job.

351
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,000
In trouble? What... what
do you mean? What is it?

352
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,600
I don't know how
they got my email.

353
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,670
Or who they are.

354
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,819
They kept sending
the same thing.

355
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,210
I tried to contact them
but it just bounced back.

356
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,390
Do you think it
might be relevant?

357
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,824
Whoever's behind this

358
00:27:28,923 --> 00:27:31,800
I am sure they one the ones
that are harassing Gough, too.

359
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,060
Look.

360
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,999
This is an incidence report
from student services

361
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,979
from Oliver Gough's university

362
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,770
about him attacking
another student.

363
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,190
He's been sent this from
an anonymous email address.

364
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,280
Someone else who has also
managed to track him down.

365
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,999
We haven't been able to pull
any prints off the ring.

366
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,470
So this could be something.

367
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,948
I understand why Gough
didn't want to see this.

368
00:27:58,048 --> 00:27:59,088
Oh, that's not the reason.

369
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,340
He said he didn't want
to get me into trouble.

370
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,961
Why would he get you in trouble?

371
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,430
Did you know about
this before his trial?

372
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,830
It came up.

373
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,710
He's attacked someone
in a student union.

374
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,709
This proves that Oliver Gough
had a history of assault.

375
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,689
It shows that he's
been in a fight before.

376
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,560
A fight?

377
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,620
What, seven stitches in the
scalp and two broken ribs.

378
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,919
He's beat the shit
out of this kid.

379
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,309
He won the fight.
He didn't start it.

380
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,480
So it looks to me like...

381
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,359
He's assaulted another student

382
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,520
and the university have
covered it up because...

383
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,349
what, because he's
on the rugby team?

384
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,809
Don't be ridiculous.

385
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,079
They've dealt with
it internally.

386
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,180
This wasn't some grand
conspiracy to protect him, okay?

387
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,549
Listen, I've read
up on this trial.

388
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,289
The real victim, Craig Nevins,
he was a decent young man.

389
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,870
You made him out to be
some violent reprobate.

390
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,109
A scum of the earth
terrorising the streets.

391
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,799
Craig Nevins' character and behaviour
on that night was relevant to the trial.

392
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,189
While poor Oliver Gough was a
good lad with a bright future

393
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,050
who was just trying
to defend himself.

394
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,989
You made it a
trial by character.

395
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,249
That's very simplistic of you.

396
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,779
Even though you
knew it was a lie.

397
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,629
I was under no obligation
to disclose information

398
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,799
hat didn't pertain to this case

399
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,650
and it is not my responsibility
to do the CPS's job for them.

400
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,729
I've been in the police
for, I think, 15 years.

401
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,260
Wow.

402
00:29:20,261 --> 00:29:21,891
I know how the system
works as well you do.

403
00:29:21,915 --> 00:29:23,179
It doesn't sound
like that to me.

404
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:28,110
At some point you have to choose
between what is right and what is wrong.

405
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,150
And do something about it.

406
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,420
It looks like someone is
trying to teach you a lesson.

407
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,400
The ring.

408
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,079
And the emails.

409
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,819
Well, it must be one
of the Nevins family

410
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,602
because who else would want to
hurt me, Belinda and Judge Stuart?

411
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,479
Just another case for you, hey?

412
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,101
I'll get us another one.

413
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,800
That got heated.

414
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,150
Where did you disappear to?

415
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,470
I had to keep an eye on Gough.

416
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,840
You can't be here.

417
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,079
What did you find out from him?

418
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,210
The police will deal with
it, but you need to leave...

419
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,799
You fully trust
Nash now, do you?

420
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,040
Because when he interviewed
me at the station, he said...

421
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,636
What are you doing here?

422
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,520
Nash, Detective Sergeant Nash.

423
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,526
- I'm arresting you for harassment.
- It's not what you think.

424
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,439
- Don't make such a show of this. She's not Emma.
- Don't say anything.

425
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,080
Stop! We drove here together.

426
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,360
I asked him.

427
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,215
I need his help
finding Oliver Gough.

428
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,749
I know what you're doing.

429
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,110
- You're being unreasonable.
- I can see through your games.

430
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,190
You two deserve each other.

431
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,720
You just don't know
when to stop, do you?

432
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,150
I don't know when to stop?

433
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:23,777
Ingrid.

434
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:24,730
Stay away from me.

435
00:32:44,218 --> 00:32:46,320
I thought you'd still take
this route to Chambers.

436
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,629
You've not been
returning my calls.

437
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,730
No, I haven't.

438
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,849
The police picked
up CCTV footage

439
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,159
of me on the motorway
driving back from Wales

440
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,690
when Judge Stuart
was killed, so...

441
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,330
I'm no longer a person of interest
in case you were wondering.

442
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,749
I, erm, spent the
night in a cell

443
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,430
and all I could think of was

444
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:09,390
how could you possibly believe that
I had anything to do with this?

445
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,910
And then, I realised...

446
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,300
Why would you trust me?

447
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,310
Why were you sending those cards

448
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,990
to Flora's parents?

449
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,020
I have a lot to be sorry for.

450
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,890
I wanted them to know that.

451
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,060
It breaks my heart that you think
I had anything to do with this.

452
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,560
Look, with everything happening,

453
00:33:34,418 --> 00:33:35,389
I don't know who to trust.

454
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,020
If anything happened to you,
I don't know what I'd do.

455
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,633
I'm not the person
you think I am, Mark.

456
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:42,769
Yes, you are.

457
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,199
No, I'm not. I wish I was.

458
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,479
But I'm not. Do you remember
when I went to Bristol?

459
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,319
For that fraud case

460
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,949
and I told you I had to
stay over for the trial.

461
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,590
I lied to you.

462
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,350
I was with him.

463
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,181
With who?

464
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,161
Webster.

465
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,450
Did you sleep with him?

466
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,561
Yeah?

467
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,289
Sorry, I wanted
to tell you and...

468
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,280
No, no, no.

469
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,050
You're right.

470
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,530
I don't know who you are.

471
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:45,990
Tom.

472
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:46,931
Tom.

473
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,817
The crown versus Oliver Gough.

474
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,419
That's one of the cases
you worked with Belinda on.

475
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,400
Yeah. The victim
was Craig Nevins.

476
00:35:58,930 --> 00:35:59,869
Police have the details.

477
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:03,309
Yeah, I know but do you remember
any of Craig Nevins' family members

478
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,420
who attended court?

479
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,690
Well, only went to
court once myself.

480
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,910
It's not like they sign in.

481
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,634
Excuse us, Tom. Can I have
a private word, Ingrid?

482
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:13,330
Outside.

483
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,002
I just received a
call from DS Nash.

484
00:36:26,653 --> 00:36:28,511
Why? What's happened? Has
someone else been killed?

485
00:36:28,535 --> 00:36:29,660
It's about you, Ingrid.

486
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,703
Look, if this is about
the Oliver Gough trial...

487
00:36:34,803 --> 00:36:37,204
No, this is nothing to do with
any trial. That's the problem.

488
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,330
This is about you obstructing
a police investigation.

489
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,540
So, it's true.

490
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,429
No, he's blown this
out of proportion.

491
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:48,219
- I didn't tamper with evidence...
- I have a vested interest

492
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,749
in this investigation

493
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,090
Sorry, Angus, why are you
being so formal with me?

494
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,279
- All I'm trying to do is get answers.
- I'd like the CPS to be able to

495
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,010
prosecute the guilty party
once the police apprehend them.

496
00:37:00,396 --> 00:37:02,249
DS Nash had no
business calling you.

497
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,440
Can't you see he's
trying to help you?

498
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,710
You committed an offence
obstructing a police officer.

499
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,910
He told me you'd been tracking
down relevant parties yourself.

500
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,439
If he'd arrested you

501
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,179
this could have ended up
with you being disbarred.

502
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,269
- Someone is trying to kill me.
- And I lost my wife

503
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,789
and the mother of my children.

504
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,409
But you don't see me running
around playing vigilante.

505
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,969
Illegally obtaining addresses.

506
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,229
We're lawyers.

507
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,910
There are standards.

508
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,370
How do you know it was DS Nash?

509
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,661
What?

510
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,900
How do you know it was
DS Nash who called you...

511
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:36,896
Oh, for goodness sake.

512
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,020
Look, I know it sounds crazy...

513
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,449
You've admitted to
engaging a crime while

514
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,339
representing these chambers
and I will not have it.

515
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,890
Why do you keep trying to stop
me? What do you have to hide?

516
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:56,020
I think you should start looking
for somewhere else to work from.

517
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,680
I don't want to start formal
proceedings against you, but I would...

518
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,030
if I had to.

519
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,200
I was actually
starting to trust you.

520
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,739
You told Angus about me
going to see Oliver Gough

521
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,429
obstructing a police officer.

522
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,050
What?

523
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:40,209
Do you think if you
ruined my career

524
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,680
you're all I'll have left?

525
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,699
This is my life you are playing
with. Do you understand?

526
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,029
I don't want any of that at all.

527
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,139
You losing your job is
the last thing I want.

528
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,190
Because I've seen you
in court, you're...

529
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,219
fierce, alive.

530
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,620
That's when I fell
in love with you.

531
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,816
Okay, but when are you going
to realise I'm on your side

532
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,720
and everything I'm
doing is to protect you?

533
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,190
How can I trust you?
I can't trust anyone

534
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,660
You can trust me.

535
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,141
You can.

536
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,880
Because I'm not like
anyone else in your life.

537
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,409
I'm not like Mark.

538
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,230
Weekends with the in-laws
and bingeing boxsets on TV.

539
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,449
I'm not like Nash.

540
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,190
You saw how he reacted in
the pub, you can't trust him.

541
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,940
I don't want the fake Ingrid.

542
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,550
I want the real thing.

543
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,321
That...

544
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,795
Message sent to Oliver Gough...

545
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,629
About the previous
attack at his university.

546
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,650
It was sent from...

547
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,559
Durbs454@mailmeforfree.com.

548
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,920
A random name on an
untraceable address.

549
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,939
Okay, so how is
that useful then?

550
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,639
Because if someone's been
logging on to that account

551
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,139
from an address in Leytonstone

552
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,300
on multiple occasions
in the last few weeks.

553
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,273
It's something.

554
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,929
Whoever's been logging
on to that account

555
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,700
from there may have
killed two people.

556
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,220
We should take
this to the police.

557
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,149
Sorry, you just told
me not to trust Nash.

558
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,850
Not Nash. DI Winstanley.

559
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,010
I meant what I said. Keeping you
safe. That's all I care about.

560
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,079
Tell me the truth.

561
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,780
Did you break any
laws getting this?

562
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,480
Yes.

563
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,680
If we take this to the police I
will have to tell them how I got it.

564
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,800
And it could end my career.

565
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,719
Over a piece of evidence

566
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,750
that will probably
lead nowhere, so...

567
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,870
I will check it out myself.

568
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:58,335
And if it is anything, then
I'll take it to DI Winstanley.

569
00:40:58,435 --> 00:40:59,790
It's not safe...

570
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,620
to go alone.

571
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,820
Let me come with you.

572
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,700
I can't force you.

573
00:41:37,637 --> 00:41:38,737
Here.

574
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,240
You sure this is
the right place?

575
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,680
Yeah.

576
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,080
This is where the IP
address traces to.

577
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,510
Craig Nevins, he
had a big family

578
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,960
a lot of brothers,
cousins, friends.

579
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,200
Yeah, so?

580
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,030
You saw them in court.
What did you think of them?

581
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,500
Hmm, they didn't like the
way I portrayed Craig.

582
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,556
They were upset,

583
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,340
volatile, but victims'
families often are.

584
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,230
Didn't get that feeling
from them though.

585
00:43:07,257 --> 00:43:08,557
What feeling?

586
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,060
That they were dangerous.

587
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,280
This is my case.

588
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,780
It's me. My name is everywhere.

589
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,450
They have all my case files.

590
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,430
Someone's been here recently.

591
00:45:02,363 --> 00:45:04,862
John! The laptop!

592
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:20,808
John! John!

593
00:46:22,138 --> 00:46:24,004
John. John!

594
00:46:24,005 --> 00:46:25,336
John!
