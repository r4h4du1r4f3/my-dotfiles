- See?
- Let me

15
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,247
See?

16
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,921
You're rubbish

17
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,346
Oi, what's wrong? Come on

18
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,931
What's up? Come on

19
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,480
Come on

20
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,210
- Mrs Okubo?
- Oh, thank you

21
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,715
- Here you go
- Thanks so much

22
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,802
- That spinach looks good
- lt's so expensive. 20 yen

23
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,723
- Really? l can't even afford spinach nowadays
- l know

24
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,308
Listen...

25
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:55,442
l heard something strange.
Our women's group fees weren't paid

26
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,694
But we paid up, didn't we?

27
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:04,660
l know, but l ran into the chairwoman
and she said we hadn't paid

28
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,412
But l definitely paid

29
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,122
So did l!

30
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,667
How odd! lt doesn't make sense

31
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,669
lt's very odd

32
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,922
- Although, thinking about it...
- What?

33
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,884
Didn't her next doorjust buy
a washing machine?

34
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,429
Yes, but in monthly instalments

35
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:28,058
But isn't that strange about our fees?

36
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,769
Mrs Okubo?

37
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,273
- That's her
- Yes?

38
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,235
- Here's the women's group bulletin board
- Thank you

39
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,113
- Welcome home
- Hello

40
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,698
You're back early

41
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,993
What's wrong with you?

42
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,577
Hi...

43
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,639
Where are you offto?
Better not be next door!

44
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,517
No, l'm going to study

45
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,982
l don't know what to do with him.
All he cares about is television

46
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,527
- lt's the sumo season, isn't it?
- That's right

47
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,448
- Listen...
- What?

48
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:28,493
What happened the other day?

49
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:32,247
- Well, it's very strange
- Why?

50
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,847
Kozo, l'm offover there

51
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:56,521
Mum, will you get me
another pair of pants?

52
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,941
What's the matter with you?
An upset stomach?

53
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,111
Why did you soil your pants?
You do this every day

54
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,698
l didn't buy a washing machine
just for your pants!

55
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,370
Mum...

56
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,040
Just give me a clean pair

57
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,169
Watching sumo is all right...

58
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:23,590
...but they never learn anything
worthwhile over there

59
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,801
You're absolutely right

60
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,012
We should have nothing
to do with them

61
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:33,308
The husband and wife laze around
in pyjamas all day long

62
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,812
She used to work in a cabaret in lkebukuro

63
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,857
So she's that kind ofwoman, is she?

64
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,530
- l should be off
- How much is the sauce, though?

65
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,866
Sort it out later.
l owe you money, too

66
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,660
- Really?
- Bye!

67
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,439
Hiya!

68
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,399
Come on in

69
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,573
- ls Minoru here yet?
- Not yet

70
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:37,122
Hailing from Hokkaido, Kitabayama
is well known for his fighting spirit

71
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:41,877
His opponent on the right
is Togashi from Yamagata...

72
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,713
Wakanohana's looking good today

73
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,799
Who do you think will win, Ko?

74
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,343
That's easy. lsn't it?

75
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,846
Course! He's got a superb throw

76
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,431
You reckon?

77
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,935
Help yourself

78
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,441
lt's time to leave, dear

79
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,827
lsn't the boy from next door coming?

80
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,289
Shall we call him?

81
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,424
- Hey, Minoru?
- Minoru!

82
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,349
- Come over
- What's the matter? Hurry up

83
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,038
- Just going out!
- l'm just going out!

84
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,707
Where are you going?

85
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,834
To study English

86
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,878
- And lsamu?
- Me too

87
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,507
You're not watching TV again, are you?
Don't be going next door

88
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,388
Silly boys!

89
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,435
Mrs Hayashi?

90
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,606
Spare a moment?

91
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,116
This might seem like a strange question...

92
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:41,079
...but did you give our women's group fees
to the chairwoman?

93
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,249
Yes, about 10 days ago, l think

94
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,586
l see. l thought so

95
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:53,258
But she says she hasn't received them yet

96
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,218
Why's that?

97
00:09:55,344 --> 00:10:01,182
Not only that, l heard that Mrs Haraguchi
just bought a washing machine

98
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,685
But she wouldn't...

99
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:08,898
l know. But Mrs Okubo says
she gave the fees to you

100
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:13,862
Yes, she did, definitely.
Shall l ask the chairwoman?

101
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,574
But ifshe says
she hasn't received them yet...

102
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,243
l definitely gave them to her

103
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,955
Ofcourse you did.
You wouldn't forget something like that

104
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,124
So how could this have happened?

105
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,377
- Well...
- This is distressing

106
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,882
Here is our very popular hero,
Wakahichibu...

107
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:39,846
...as he performs
the salt ceremony in the ring

108
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,642
And now he faces his opponent
in this title match...

109
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,274
Good day to...

110
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,779
You here again, Kozo?
Don't you ever listen?

111
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,656
Good day

112
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,662
Sorry my son's always round here
bothering you

113
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,165
What about your English lessons?

114
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:11,252
What about you, Minoru?
And Zen, your mother will scold you, too

115
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,299
- They must be such a nuisance for you
- l don't mind at all

116
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,553
All right, time to go home.
Come on, you lot

117
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,515
l'm not going.
l've finished my English homework

118
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,976
What? l'll tell your mother.
Come on!

119
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,357
Thank you so much

120
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,035
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

121
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:50,166
Say hello to your teacher
from "big sister"

122
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,587
- "Big sister"? You mean from you?
- Who else do you think?

123
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,257
Bye

124
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,565
What took you so long?
What about your English lessons?

125
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,996
Hello. Anybody home?

126
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,789
Yes, who is it?

127
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,504
l just spoke with Mrs Tomizawa...

128
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:41,885
...and told her l handed over our fees
more than a week ago

129
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:47,265
All this fuss makes me feel
that l'm somehow responsible

130
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,933
l'm really sorry

131
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,562
Don't worry about it, Mrs Hayashi

132
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:58,234
We know it's not your fault.
You didn't have to come to tell me that

133
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,611
But l...

134
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:03,907
lt's only because Mrs Tomizawa
mentioned a washing machine...

135
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:08,036
...that l began to wonder what happened

136
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:14,834
- That isn't what concerns me, though
- Well, ofcourse it shouldn't

137
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,422
But why hasn't the chairwoman
received the fees yet?

138
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,509
This is all just so unpleasant for you,
isn't it?

139
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:28,056
l'll ask Mrs Haraguchi.
l feel it's my responsibility

140
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:33,520
Oh, l wouldn't bother with that.
lt would only trouble her

141
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,063
But l...

142
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,650
You don't have to worry.
We all trust you

143
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:42,862
Time will tell who's to blame.
Don't you worry yourself

144
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:47,992
lt's a whodunit,
just like in that film, remember?

145
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:51,704
- But l...
- Don't worry about it

146
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,025
What are you up to?

147
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,580
- Have you finished that translation yet?
- l'm working on it

148
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,881
Are you two done?

149
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,847
Go on and read it to me

150
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,398
Translate the meaning

151
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:05,987
'My sister is three years old.
She is younger than l am.'

152
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,531
No, that's a bit different

153
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,409
How about you, Kozo?

154
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,123
l mean translate it

155
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,793
What does it mean?

156
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,046
Try to translate it

157
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,840
Go on

158
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,138
- Sorry, it's second nature now
- What is?

159
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,516
We all do it now.
Nudge me here again

160
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,483
Silly lad!

161
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,110
- Are you all right?
- Course l am

162
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,029
What is it?

163
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:52,909
l've been eating pumice powder
every day

164
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,621
- Who told you to do something daft like that?
- Zen's dad

165
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:00,541
lt doesn't help, you know.
He was only teasing you

166
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:06,005
But it's true. lsn't it?
His dad's really good at it

167
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,145
Did you call me?

168
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,439
- No
- Really?

169
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:43,793
- l'm back
- l'm back

170
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,378
Minoru?

171
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:50,591
Why don't you ever listen to a word l say?
You were next door again

172
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,136
So what? We just went to watch TV

173
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,138
But l told you no

174
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,849
- Then buy us a TV
- Absolutely not

175
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,559
Buy us a TV!

176
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,103
No. Now eat your supper

177
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,696
Here

178
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,121
Go ahead

179
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,047
What? Dried fish and miso soup again?

180
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,840
Don't complain

181
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,635
Are you going to complain, too, lsamu?

182
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,805
No, l won't

183
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,563
Welcome home

184
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,191
Evening

185
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,903
- You came together?
- Yes, from the station

186
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,535
- Welcome home
- We're having dried fish again, Dad

187
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,789
lsamu! You said you wouldn't complain

188
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,249
Hi, boys

189
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,003
- The pork soup tastes good, Auntie
- ls it? Good

190
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,881
- We get it every night, though
- For you

191
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,513
Auntie?

192
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,390
What is it?

193
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:26,604
My teacher said that
the translation will be ready tomorrow

194
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,564
All right

195
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,192
How did Wakanohana do today?

196
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,862
Dunno. We don't have a TV set

197
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,116
Mum, buy us a TV

198
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,992
No way

199
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,453
What about the radio?

200
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,040
- lt has to be a TV
- Can't see nothing on the radio

201
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,752
- Buy us a TV set, Mum
- Buy us a TV set!

202
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,463
l said no and l mean no

203
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,259
Would you like a bath?

204
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,302
You filled the tub already?

205
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,559
Who spilled toothpaste in the bathroom?

206
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,727
- Not me
- Me neither

207
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,938
Who was it then?

208
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,107
You two, really...

209
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,819
l don't know

210
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,863
Me neither

211
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,938
- Good morning, sir
- Good morning, sir

212
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,523
Morning

213
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,154
Hey, don't dawdle on the way

214
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,739
Yes, sir!

215
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,413
Hey...ready?

216
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,171
That's rubbish!

217
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,719
Good one. Now nudge me

218
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,596
Let me do it

219
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,975
How about that?

220
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,188
You're really good at it, Zen.
Do you eat sweet potatoes?

221
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,648
No!

222
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,080
- Did you call me?
- No

223
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,425
What is it?

224
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:06,055
Listen, l'm going to Kameido.
Want me to pick up some cakes?

225
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,266
Yes, get some

226
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,726
Oh, it's such a lovely day

227
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,206
Yes?

228
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,836
- Oh, morning
- Morning

229
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,421
You're early

230
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:44,802
- Have you finished the translations?
- l've had to look up every technical term

231
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,763
l'm about 70% through

232
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,392
My office needs it by today

233
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,437
- How's the rest going?
- Let me see

234
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,899
Do you want to take this, then?

235
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,533
- l'll finish the rest today
- Today for sure?

236
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,118
Yeah

237
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,329
Sis, Setsuko's here

238
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,961
Welcome. l thought it was you

239
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,672
- Good morning
- Morning. Offto work already?

240
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,592
Yes. Sorry to have to bother your brother

241
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,303
Not at all, it's extra income

242
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,515
My company went bankrupt,
so l'll do just about anything

243
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:35,519
Thanks for what you've done. Goodbye

244
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,188
Oh, Setsuko?

245
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:42,026
There's talk about having
our class reunion at Chinzanso Restaurant

246
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:46,489
- Tell your sister
- Yes, l will. Bye

247
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,617
- See you soon
- Thank you

248
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,077
Bye

249
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,206
Setsuko's a nice girl

250
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,807
Wouldn't it be nice ifshe married you?

251
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,769
You're kidding? l'm out of a job

252
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:21,649
That's not a problem.
You'll find another one

253
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:25,444
What about yourjob? How are sales?

254
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:30,783
- l may sell another Austin today
- Really? That's great

255
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,049
Hello? Anybody home?

256
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,678
- Hello?
- Yes?

257
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:39,268
Oh, Mrs Haraguchi.
You should've come through the front

258
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,937
Never mind that.
Can l have a word?

259
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:45,107
Please come in. What is it?

260
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,569
lt's a mess, but please come in

261
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,987
All right

262
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,909
Please...

263
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,583
So you know we bought
a washing machine?

264
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,752
Yes, l heard

265
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,923
l'd love one, too, but we can't afford it yet

266
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:14,428
You should just buy one ifyou want one.
lt's your money, why worry about it?

267
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,306
We're not rich like you

268
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:21,018
But we bought one
without making a big fuss about it

269
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,272
My mother's making money, too, you know

270
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,566
We don't need to steal
the women's group fees

271
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,195
The very idea of it. How insulting!

272
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,615
Who said such a thing?

273
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:40,246
Don't pretend you don't know.
You should ask yourselfthat question

274
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:44,625
- What?
- l'm fastidious by nature

275
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,294
l'd never steal a thing

276
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:52,633
Such hateful gossip.
l'm going to quit my post

277
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,219
l've simply been made a fool of

278
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,973
l'm afraid l don't understand

279
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,686
The women's group fees!
You're the treasurer, aren't you?

280
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,522
What about it?

281
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,192
You said you gave me the fees...

282
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,529
...so now l look like a thief

283
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,991
l'll give it you straight,
l've received nothing

284
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,702
Oh? l took them over, l'm sure

285
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,247
- When?
- The 28th of last month

286
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,374
- l received nothing
- But l delivered them

287
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,001
No, l received nothing!

288
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,420
But l definitely gave them to your mother

289
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,339
Then she would have given them to me

290
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:36,010
l wouldn't know. You should ask her

291
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,888
- Hello?
- Yes?

292
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,849
Excuse me a moment

293
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,811
Good day.
Are you the mistress ofthe house?

294
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,896
Right, then...

295
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,025
l have rubber strings, toothbrushes...

296
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,486
...pencils or brushes?

297
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,323
We have everything we need

298
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,075
Really? Everything?

299
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,245
That's what everybody says

300
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,998
How about a pencil?

301
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,502
Quiet round here, isn't it?

302
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,589
Sorry, but we don't need anything

303
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:19,303
Nothing? Don't say that.
Come on, buy a pencil

304
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,972
lt sharpens well

305
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,353
How about you, madam?
Want a pencil?

306
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:32,775
l have pencils, rubber strings,
toothbrushes, brushes?

307
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,697
Hey, madam! Madam?

308
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,241
Oh, well, whatever...

309
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,673
- Mother...
- What's all the fuss?

310
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,509
- Has a salesman called by?
- Haven't seen one

311
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,053
Will you talk to him if he calls round?
He's awful

312
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,807
Why? What happened?

313
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,811
- Anybody home?
- See? That's him

314
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,980
Yes, who is it?

315
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,653
Good day to you

316
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:27,746
l have rubber strings, toothbrushes, pencils

317
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,125
And scrubbing brushes

318
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,588
No, thanks

319
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,766
Don't you need a pencil? lt sharpens well

320
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,685
No, thanks

321
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,689
Don't say that to me. Buy a pencil

322
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,483
Can l sharpen it first and see?

323
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:00,988
Ofcourse, sharpen it. Go ahead, here

324
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:06,076
Never mind.
l'll sharpen it with my own knife

325
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:14,418
l've got cotton, too, madam. Want some?

326
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,003
No, thanks

327
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,722
Give me the pencil, then

328
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,819
That's sharp

329
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,614
How much are the toothbrushes?

330
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,117
50 yen

331
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,828
That's expensive. Too expensive!

332
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,051
What's the matter? You leaving?

333
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,638
Come again

334
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,349
Shut the door!

335
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,987
- ls he gone?
- Yes, he even left a pencil. See?

336
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:28,534
- No one stands a chance against you
- Can't be a coward and be a midwife

337
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:37,709
Listen, Mother, you didn't by any chance
receive the women's group fees, did you?

338
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,588
l would have given them to you

339
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,591
- That's right
- Ofcourse

340
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:49,179
Mrs Hayashi swears she paid you
the end of last month

341
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,098
l received nothing

342
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,562
What is it?

343
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,523
Hold on a minute

344
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,780
ls this it?

345
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,827
Yes, it is!

346
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,663
Why didn't you hand it to me?

347
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,081
Well, l...

348
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,419
Well, what?

349
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:25,090
Thanks to you, l can't go anywhere
without feeling ashamed

350
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:29,845
l'm the chairwoman,
l get blamed for everything

351
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,389
You're so forgetful

352
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:37,561
Why don't you go to Mt Narayama
with all the other dying old folk?

353
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,565
l just feel so angry!

354
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:47,738
l've been humiliated for no reason.
And by a senile old woman!

355
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,158
lt's really more than l can take!

356
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,583
Always fussing

357
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,420
Thinks she managed to grow up
all by herself

358
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,964
She drives me crazy

359
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,551
And her good-for-nothing husband

360
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,721
Thinks she's the bee's knees

361
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,307
And bearing a son like that

362
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,684
The cheek of her!

363
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,068
lt's me again

364
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,070
So sorry about earlier

365
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,076
l'm so sorry

366
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:39,498
My mother is terrible

367
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:44,211
She just told me she received the fees

368
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,464
l don't think l can apologise enough

369
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,549
l'm dreadfully sorry

370
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,803
Well, now that you realise, it's all right

371
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,975
l'm truly sorry.
l feel like crawling into a hole

372
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,352
Please forget what l said earlier

373
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:04,064
Very well. lt's all water under the bridge

374
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,149
- Really?
- Ofcourse

375
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,568
Oh, l'm so glad. Thanks

376
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:16,076
Don't tell anybody, will you?
You know how people gossip

377
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,245
No, l won't

378
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,664
Thanks again. Bye

379
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,341
Mrs Haraguchi?

380
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,681
- Come and look at these
- What is it?

381
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:42,060
lt's an alarm. The patent's pending

382
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,188
ln the case of a burglary or fire,
you just push this...

383
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:49,359
...and it can be heard 200 metres away

384
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:54,281
- A burglar alarm?
- Yes. lt deters pushy salesmen, too

385
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:58,243
lfonly you'd come sooner!
Did that fellow show up?

386
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:04,124
l had to buy pencils. Rubber bands, too

387
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:09,546
The police recommend this device
against those types ofsalesmen

388
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,216
Would you like one, madam?

389
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,802
Well, shall l buy one?

390
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:20,348
- How about your place?
- l have something even better

391
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,018
- You do?
- My mother

392
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,270
Nothing gets through her!

393
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,615
- What a lovely day
- lt certainly is

394
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,344
UKlYO RESTAURANT

395
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:12,442
- l'm done
- All right. One more!

396
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,069
Coming!

397
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,034
lt's so cold

398
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:27,791
- Where've you been?
- l bought this when l went out

399
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,546
Tomorrow's races?
Are you really into that?

400
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,299
How about the third race?

401
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,512
No good. Not a chance. Not worth it

402
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,347
- No?
- No

403
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,725
- How about the other way?
- No way

404
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,352
Here you are

405
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,229
You think so?

406
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,898
Give us another one

407
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,694
- Get one more
- All right

408
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,281
- Welcome
- Hello

409
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,661
Did l leave my gloves here?

410
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,123
Have you seen any gloves?

411
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,208
No, l haven't

412
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,585
All right

413
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:16,131
- Mr Hayashi...
- Oh, hello

414
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,176
Come and have a seat

415
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,887
Come and sit down

416
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,100
Give me some stew

417
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,853
- Here
- Thanks

418
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,439
Here you are

419
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,906
Where were you today?

420
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,910
Well, l have no prospects...

421
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,037
...but l still have to eat

422
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,164
Here, thanks

423
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,587
When is it for you?

424
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,507
Here you are

425
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,762
Retirement. l'm talking about retirement

426
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,015
lt's awful. lt's like being killed slowly

427
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:12,520
The companies think we don't need to eat
after we retire

428
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,148
But l eat and drink

429
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:22,239
My wife gives me a hard time,
but l just can't find a job

430
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,158
l'm stuck in a rut

431
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,412
There's no place under the sky to hide

432
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,873
lt's so awful

433
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:37,254
What about your pension, Mr Tomizawa?

434
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,591
No, no way, the company's too smart

435
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,053
They won't pay out much

436
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:50,016
For 30 years, come rain or shine...

437
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,771
...riding in jam-packed trains...

438
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,402
lt's all for nothing. Nothing

439
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,699
Mr Tomizawa...

440
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,743
Mr Tomizawa?

441
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,621
Leave me alone

442
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,298
Give us some potato cake

443
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,660
What are you doing? You're not eating

444
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,871
Not eating!

445
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,166
No? Fine

446
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,670
lt's no fun!

447
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,765
You're being awful. Just behave!

448
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,475
You're being stingy

449
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,978
You can go hungry, for all l care!

450
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,064
What about you, lsamu?

451
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,149
l won't eat

452
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,692
Do as you please

453
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:39,250
Silly boys. How long are you
going to keep this up?

454
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,294
Come here, lsamu

455
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,713
lsamu!

456
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,761
l'm not coming

457
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:56,851
Minoru, why are you being
so unreasonable? l'll tell your father

458
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,271
l don't care. l'm not afraid

459
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,111
That's your father now

460
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,572
lt's your father

461
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,658
Welcome home

462
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,702
- lt's cold out, isn't it?
- Yeah

463
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,580
l ran into Mr Tomizawa near the station

464
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:20,041
- He was fairly drunk
- Really?

465
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,423
- What's going on here?
- They're being awkward

466
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,843
- Why?
- They won't listen to a word l say

467
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,220
What?

468
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:36,099
l've told them not to, but they insist
on going next door to watch TV

469
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,018
So, buy us one, then!

470
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:44,399
They went next door
instead of English class again today

471
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,860
They're driving me up the wall

472
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,778
Then buy us a TV set!

473
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,989
Buy us one!

474
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:56,619
- No way
- Then we'll just go next door and watch

475
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:57,912
Me, too

476
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,540
You're being so stubborn!

477
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,501
l don't care. You're the stubborn one!

478
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,463
We only go there
because we don't have a TV at home!

479
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,257
We wouldn't go ifwe had one!

480
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,720
- Quiet!
- Stop it, or your father will scold you

481
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,847
l'm not afraid!

482
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,934
- l said quiet
- l won't. l don't have to

483
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,352
Look here!

484
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:26,691
- What did you say?
- Let me go! Let go!

485
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:30,528
You talk too much.
When l tell you to stop, you stop!

486
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,782
l didn't say anything

487
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,871
Creating a fuss over such a small thing,
you sound like a woman!

488
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,625
Children shouldn't answer back,
so just be quiet!

489
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,713
See? Now you've been scolded

490
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,800
l don't care. l want a TV

491
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,844
Stop answering back

492
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,306
Grown-ups talk all the time

493
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:03,144
"Hello. Good morning. Good evening.
Have a good day."

494
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,562
ldiot!

495
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,566
"How far is it? Just a little way.
ls that so?"

496
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:13,029
Just a lot oftalk. "l see, l see."
Forget it!

497
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,114
Silence! Be quiet!

498
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,956
Boys shouldn't prattle on

499
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,458
Be quiet

500
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,962
Fine. l'll be silent for days, then

501
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,382
Oh, l'd certainly appreciate that

502
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:36,052
- For 100 days
- Don't you start

503
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,971
No more talking

504
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,139
Come on, lsamu

505
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:48,356
- Right!
- What are we going to do with them?

506
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,496
Don't ever speak, lsamu

507
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,541
No matter what they say

508
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,044
You understand? l mean it

509
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,716
- Don't talk, whatever happens
- Outdoors, too?

510
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,926
Yes, l'll test you...

511
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,308
- Good
- My go!

512
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,147
- Okay?
- Okay

513
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,400
- This means l can talk, okay?
- Okay

514
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,245
Farting's allowed

515
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,758
- l'm home
- Welcome back

516
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,177
You're late

517
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:08,311
Listen, Miss Fukui said
your class reunion may be at Chinzanso

518
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,439
- Really? Were you over there?
- Yes, just now

519
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,524
- Where are the boys?
- ln their room

520
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,901
Okay

521
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,511
Good, good. Studying hard?

522
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,894
Do you want some cakes?
They're really tasty

523
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,446
See? Want some?

524
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,874
What's wrong? Don't you want any?

525
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:21,384
All right, then. We'll eat it.
lt's awfully good, though

526
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,481
l'm hungry. Aren't you?

527
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,139
For good health and good business...

528
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,777
Mother! Time to eat! Mother?

529
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:48,554
Buy a couple of pairs of pants for him
on your way home, will you?

530
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,727
- Again?
- Yes. Cheap ones will do

531
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,191
More?

532
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,864
You shouldn't.
Otherwise, your stomach won't get better

533
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,248
Here

534
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,531
Seconds?

535
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:56,163
This is so nice. lt's so quiet

536
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,249
Don't say a word

537
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,843
How long do you think it'll last?

538
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,773
Say goodbye

539
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:34,452
Morning. You're early today.
Kozo's still getting ready

540
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,877
Kozo. Kozo!

541
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,053
Morning, lsamu. That's a lovely scarf

542
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:18,037
- Did you have a fight with Minoru?
- No, l didn't

543
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,249
See you later

544
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,586
What's going on? Very odd...

545
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,758
Such odd children

546
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,971
- What's going on?
- What?

547
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:41,185
The children from across the way
didn't even say "good morning"

548
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,522
So what?

549
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:50,695
They both just looked at me
and didn't say a word

550
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,908
Do you think Mrs Hayashi
is still mad at me about yesterday?

551
00:49:57,202 --> 00:50:01,330
- Yesterday?
- About the women's group fees

552
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:05,292
l don't think so.
Things like that happen all the time

553
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,796
lt's all because ofyour mother's senility,
you know

554
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,048
She didn't say anything to me

555
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:16,178
lf l hadn't asked her,
she might have spent the money

556
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,223
No, l wouldn't have!

557
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,977
We all forget things

558
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,188
l don't. Not important things

559
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,315
Ofcourse you do!

560
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,361
l should know

561
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,865
What's that?
What have l ever forgotten?

562
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:40,327
That gas bill l paid for you

563
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,329
ls that all?

564
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,291
You do it, too, you know.
You just ignore your own faults

565
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,879
Enough already, give it a rest!

566
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,467
l'm going out

567
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,720
See you later

568
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:10,483
Saying she never forgets!

569
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:13,694
And she didn't even remember
to pay me back

570
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,238
Always shooting her mouth off

571
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,242
How on earth did l get a daughter like her?

572
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,046
Morning

573
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,840
Morning.
Has your husband gone for the day?

574
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,258
Yep

575
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,095
l need a word with you

576
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,393
- What?
- She's an odd one

577
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,397
- The cabaret woman?
- Oh, she's impossible, but l mean Mrs Hayashi

578
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,649
How?

579
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,528
Just because l was late
with the women's group fees...

580
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,823
...she's been telling everyone
l used the money to buy a washing machine

581
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,242
Has she? That's awful

582
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:05,329
l know. So l went over to complain

583
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:09,208
She apologised, and l thought
we'd put the matter to rest

584
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:13,629
But she's obviously still angry.
She's even told her children

585
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:17,967
When l spoke to them this morning,
they completely ignored me

586
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,760
l can't bear it

587
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,555
ls she really like that?

588
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:26,350
She is. l was surprised as well

589
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,270
- l never thought she was like that
- l know

590
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,356
She obviously holds grudges,
so you better watch out

591
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,192
You think so? You might be right

592
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,487
Do you think l should return the beer
l borrowed?

593
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:42,575
- Did you borrow some?
- We were completely out

594
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,870
The other night?
Then you better hurry and return it

595
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:49,498
You're right. l'm glad you told me

596
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,671
Good morning

597
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:30,831
- Hello?
- Oh, come in

598
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,963
l forgot all about the beer

599
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,966
l borrowed it the other day

600
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,555
That's all right. There's no rush

601
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:50,768
And this is for the bus ticket
you bought for me

602
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,979
No, really, it's fine

603
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,148
No, l should return it

604
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,151
Sorry and thank you

605
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,132
Mrs Tomizawa?

606
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,969
Are you there?

607
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,933
Hey, Mrs Okubo's here

608
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,479
Oh, do come in

609
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,606
What is it?

610
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:42,778
lfyou've ever borrowed something
from Mrs Hayashi, you'd better return it

611
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:47,700
- Why?
- Apparently, she likes to hold a grudge

612
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,619
No. l've borrowed from her plenty oftimes

613
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:54,623
But she does. l was told so

614
00:54:54,749 --> 00:55:01,046
l was shocked. She seems well educated,
but one never knows, eh?

615
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,007
You think so?

616
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:08,470
Our cat stole some of her dried fish.
Do you think l should return it?

617
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,472
Absolutely, you should!

618
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,558
Maybe you're right

619
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,728
l already have.
lt's such a weight off my chest

620
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,702
So, you start with the last letter
ofthe last word

621
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:36,832
Crow, worm, moon

622
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,754
Okay, what's next?

623
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,633
Yes, Akita

624
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,428
The Moonlight Masked Man

625
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:53,974
The Moonlight Masked Man?
No, the word has to start with an N

626
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,065
You, Shimizu

627
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,525
lt's Captain Redbreast!

628
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:06,528
No, no.
Start with the letter N

629
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,034
Yes, Hayashi

630
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:18,290
What starts with the letter N?

631
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:25,589
There are lots ofwords that do,
aren't there?

632
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:31,053
What is it? What's wrong?

633
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:37,059
What does that mean?
ls something wrong?

634
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,519
The toilet?

635
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,608
What does that mean?
What's wrong?

636
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,820
What is it?

637
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:55,119
Okay, read it out loud for me

638
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,962
What are you waiting for?
Can't you read it?

639
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,842
You know what it says

640
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,679
Right, stay there

641
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,895
That's all for today

642
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:27,734
Don't forget to bring
your lunch money tomorrow

643
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,070
- Yes, sir
- Good

644
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:34,283
And please remember to bring
your lunch money tomorrow

645
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,909
Yes, Miss!

646
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,164
Understand?
Please raise your hand ifyou do

647
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,540
Yes, miss!

648
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,709
What about our lunch money?
Should l tell mum?

649
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:29,171
- No way. And no more talking
- What do we do, then?

650
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,940
How long do you think
they'll keep it up?

651
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:52,569
Just ignore them.
They're at that rebellious stage

652
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,864
They take after their father

653
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,620
- What?
- They're so stubborn and awkward

654
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:05,958
- They take after you, then
- That's so not true. ls it?

655
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,210
lt makes you wonder

656
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,676
What is it?

657
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,974
- What?
- What is it?

658
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:34,611
- What do you think?
- l don't know. Any ideas, brother?

659
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,405
No

660
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,369
What is it?

661
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,708
A building? A large house?

662
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:52,004
The government building?
A temple? A hospital?

663
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,880
No?

664
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,507
A school?

665
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,759
School? What about school?

666
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,890
ls it on fire?

667
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:07,436
Not a fire? lt's not on fire?

668
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,733
Drinking tea? Then what?

669
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,112
Drinking tea and eating?

670
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,327
Money? ls it money?

671
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:33,170
Got it! The firemen put out the fire,
and you paid them and gave them tea?

672
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,382
- What?
- l wonder...

673
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:53,190
- Have you got it?
- l haven't got a clue. What's this about?

674
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,692
l wonder...

675
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,528
What could it be?

676
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:16,004
One, two, three, four, five, six...

677
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,940
He's really good

678
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,901
Ofcourse, my dad works
for the gas company

679
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:46,243
Minoru's good, too, he's refusing to talk

680
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:49,454
Not even at school

681
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,417
...five, six, seven, eight

682
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:58,964
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

683
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:24,197
Hey...why won't you talk?

684
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,958
Don't you find it inconvenient?

685
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:44,134
Hey, what's wrong?

686
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,306
Did you take a vow or something?

687
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,142
What is it?

688
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,727
Hey

689
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,451
Silly lads

690
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,331
Still eating pumice powder every day?

691
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:21,546
lfyou keep that up,
you'll die with a stomach full ofstones

692
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:26,343
- Really?
- Absolutely

693
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:32,349
You know that seal that died at the zoo?
lts stomach was full ofstones

694
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:37,020
lt thought the stones that
the visitors threw were food

695
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,690
Who is it?

696
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:44,027
- Hello
- Oh, it's you. What is it?

697
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:48,782
What are you doing here, boys?
Why don't you come and watch TV?

698
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,660
Are there any vacant flats here?

699
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,871
l don't think so.
You should ask downstairs

700
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:58,250
Really?
Do you know of anywhere else?

701
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,919
l don't know. Who's looking?

702
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:06,341
Me! l want to move.
The neighbours are so interfering

703
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:11,304
- Don't you know of anywhere at all?
- Not really

704
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:16,351
You're a cold fish, aren't you? Bye!

705
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,991
Yes?

706
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,452
Oh, it's you

707
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,871
Hello

708
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,583
So you're here?

709
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,294
l have more translation work for you

710
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,505
- Was the other translation all right?
- Yes

711
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:48,842
l'll be back in four or five days for these

712
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:52,012
All right. And thanks for the work

713
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,807
Thank you

714
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:59,352
What happened to these two?
They won't talk

715
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:04,900
They were scolded for talking too much,
so now they won't talk at all

716
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,485
Really? How funny

717
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,321
What was it you said?

718
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,579
Come on, lsamu. Hey!

719
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:24,628
- What's the matter with them?
- They said adults talk too much, too

720
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:29,925
"Good morning. Good evening.
Good day. Have a good day."

721
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:34,429
Oh, l see. They have a point.
We do say those things

722
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:37,307
We all certainly do

723
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:41,102
But such things are perhaps necessary,
don't you think?

724
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:45,440
lt'd be a dull world
without such conventions

725
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:50,737
Yes, but the children
don't understand that yet

726
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:53,365
No, they've no idea about such things

727
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:58,036
But it makes the world go round

728
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,707
That's what l think, anyway

729
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:06,795
Hey, lsamu.
What are you angry about?

730
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:15,220
You're right, l agree

731
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:20,183
Well, anyway,
let's have another drink

732
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:24,896
Oh, easy, easy

733
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:27,607
- Too much?
- No, not at all

734
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:29,693
Never mind

735
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:34,614
But drinking and smoking
are a waste oftime, too

736
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,282
But why worry?

737
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,244
You're right

738
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:44,207
l know how the kids feel
when they pester you to buy a TV

739
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:49,295
l'd like one, too,
but l can't afford it

740
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:53,967
Finances aren't the problem.
l'm simply against buying one

741
01:06:54,885 --> 01:07:00,140
l remember hearing someone say that
TVjust produces a society of idiots

742
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:03,727
ls that so?
What do they mean?

743
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:07,647
lt means that the Japanese
will be reduced to idiots

744
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:12,652
Now, that would be a travesty.
l see your point

745
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,363
But what does it really mean?

746
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:18,158
Hey, mister, what do you think?

747
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:24,039
- What?
- About television?

748
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:25,498
Television?

749
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,209
You mean the idiot box?

750
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:31,212
You've heard that?

751
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:35,383
Oh, yeah.
TV's a total waste oftime

752
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:37,218
You think so?

753
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,931
That's what people think, eh?

754
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:49,105
l guess it's a bad idea to have
too much convenience in life

755
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,690
That's right

756
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:52,692
A bad idea...

757
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,039
l'm home

758
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,929
Have you come to visit us?

759
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:24,432
lt's nice to see you.
You're a good boy

760
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,813
Welcome home

761
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:33,066
Sorry, Mrs Hayashi

762
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:37,153
ls my wife out?
Thanks so much for house-sitting

763
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,156
Actually, your home's next door

764
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,037
Gosh, sorry about that!

765
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:50,917
- Do you need a hand?
- No, l'm fine

766
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:11,938
l'm home

767
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:17,443
l feel good

768
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:20,530
Have you been drinking again?

769
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:25,535
l found the right place this time!

770
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,622
l feel good

771
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,959
What on earth are you on about?

772
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,547
l feel good, so leave me alone

773
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,053
l feel so good

774
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,590
Honey, are you done?

775
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,176
Still in the middle of it

776
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:32,060
- What time's the truck coming?
- lt'll be here around 3:00, so hurry up

777
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,904
What are you doing? What's the rush?

778
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,045
Looks like the next door neighbours
are moving

779
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:03,883
l saw. Neighbours can be
a nuisance, though

780
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,803
l feel like moving, too

781
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:11,182
But wherever you go,
you have neighbours

782
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:13,476
Unless you live in the mountains, that is

783
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,103
True

784
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:19,816
Listen, do mice gnaw on pumice stone?

785
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:24,529
Well...l don't think so

786
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:28,032
That's odd, then,
because it's disappearing fast

787
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:31,244
Maybe l should put some rat poison on it

788
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,935
l'm hungry. We haven't had any snacks

789
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:03,359
l don't think we should eat pumice stone
anymore. Won't we die?

790
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:12,577
We're not full ofstones yet, are we?
We're okay, right?

791
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:22,545
Anybody home?

792
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:27,133
- lt's our teacher
- What'll we do?

793
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,761
Come on

794
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,674
ls that so?

795
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:12,762
l scolded them for talking too much

796
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:16,641
l see. At least now l understand
what's going on

797
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:20,061
The youngest won't talk, either

798
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:22,980
l'm sorry they've been so much trouble

799
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:26,651
Raising children is a difficult task

800
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:29,779
Please be more strict with them at school

801
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:34,117
- We wouldn't mind at all
- No, l'm afraid l couldn't

802
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,120
Oh, you have a guest?

803
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,790
Please, come in. l was just leaving

804
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,458
Thank you and goodbye

805
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:46,712
Thank you. l'll make sure they bring
their lunch money tomorrow

806
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,923
Thank you

807
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:55,721
- Come in, Mr Tomizawa
- Thanks. Excuse me

808
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:00,476
Beautiful weather, isn't it?

809
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:04,147
Yes, it's been a lovely spell

810
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:56,199
- Welcome
- l'm sorry about last night

811
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,951
l was scolded by my wife this morning

812
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,538
You seem in good spirits today

813
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:09,128
l wanted to tell you my good fortune.
l found a job

814
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:12,590
Really? That's great

815
01:15:12,716 --> 01:15:15,343
lt's not a big company

816
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:20,848
Kowa Electric Company. Do you know it?
lt's in Kuromon-cho

817
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:24,810
- l'm in sales
- That's great

818
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:29,857
lt's hard work, though

819
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:33,528
l have to do door-to-door, selling these...

820
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:39,575
Oh, l see. Toasters, mixers

821
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:48,292
And washing machines, too

822
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:52,505
- Yes. How about buying one?
- We couldn't

823
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:55,883
How about something for you?

824
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:58,094
Well...

825
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:01,347
We do monthly instalments as well

826
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:07,061
We must buy something
to celebrate your newjob

827
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:10,940
Please do that.
l have plenty ofother catalogues

828
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,276
Just a minute, l'll get them

829
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,069
Back in a jiffy

830
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:31,252
lt's time for us to think about it, too

831
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:34,297
What?

832
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,756
Retirement

833
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:35,358
Want some tea?

834
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:37,360
Yes, please

835
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,082
Messy, isn't it?

836
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,627
Fun, isn't it?

837
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,467
l want rice

838
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:19,527
Tastes good

839
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:24,573
Should've brought some side dishes

840
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,785
- Shall l get some?
- Yes, go get some

841
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,447
Hey, brother...

842
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:25,885
Hurry up!

843
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:02,755
Who is it?

844
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,640
- Hello
- Good evening

845
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:18,687
- Our boys aren't here, are they?
- No. ls anything wrong?

846
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:21,607
Were they here this afternoon?

847
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:23,776
No, not today

848
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:32,535
- What is it?
- The boys ran offsomewhere this afternoon

849
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,663
Really? You must be worried

850
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:40,376
Yes. But they may be home now.
Good night

851
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:41,961
Take care

852
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:43,963
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

853
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,591
l wonder what's going on

854
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:05,943
They're funny, those kids.
Are they still not talking?

855
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:08,487
l think it's quite interesting

856
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:14,118
For children, our greetings may seem
mundane, like a waste oftime

857
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:19,874
l do it all the time at work to sell cars,
l have to

858
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,044
Yes, it acts as a social lubricant
in our world

859
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:27,548
But important things can be difficult to say

860
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:31,302
True. Whereas, meaningless things
are easy to say

861
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:36,140
- You're like that, too
- What do you mean?

862
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:39,226
- Can't admit you're in love
- What?

863
01:21:39,352 --> 01:21:43,439
l'm talking about Setsuko.
You only talk about the weather and work...

864
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,942
- ...but you never say how you feel
- But that's different

865
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,612
No, it's not. l know

866
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:55,534
You should get round
to the important things

867
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:03,959
Why don't you go out and look?

868
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:06,295
- For what?
- The kids

869
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:09,131
They've been out since this afternoon?
lt's too long

870
01:22:11,843 --> 01:22:15,429
- Shall l go and have look for them?
- Yes, go on

871
01:22:21,686 --> 01:22:23,854
lt's cold out. Wrap up warm

872
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:41,288
Check around the cinema, will you?

873
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:24,081
l'm home. Are Minoru and lsamu back?

874
01:23:24,207 --> 01:23:26,291
- Not yet
- Really?

875
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:31,714
l went to the teacher's flat, too

876
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,632
What's that?

877
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:36,343
l got it at the police station

878
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:39,054
They said they left them and ran away

879
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:45,394
Where could they have got to?
Do you have any idea?

880
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,150
l'll go and look around

881
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:52,693
No, l'll go

882
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:56,363
- Where would they go?
- Nuisances!

883
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,577
lt's cold out. Wrap up warm

884
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:05,205
- Good evening

903
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:40,843

905
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:48,725
And Mr Tomizawa brought it over

906
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:51,770
- How much?
- lt's expensive!

907
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:54,523
- How much?
- Never you mind

908
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:57,442
But you two have to study hard now

909
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:59,111

How lucky are we?

912
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:14,251
Hey, we can watch baseball, too

913
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:16,253
We are so lucky!

914
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:20,716
Hey, aren't you two hungry at all?

915
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:24,970

01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:26,763
Dumplings, too!

01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,724

01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:54,583
He's lying. His face says so

922
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,085
He's smiling

923
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:40,128

924
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,713

925
01:27:41,839 --> 01:27:45,676
Mum, make sure the TV's all set
when we come home

926
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:47,761
See you later!

927
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:00,774
Good morning!
Has Kozo already left?

928
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:05,737
Kozo. Kozo!

929
01:28:08,574 --> 01:28:11,994
Good morning!
Has Zen gone already?

930
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:16,248
- Yes, he just left
- Okay

931
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:19,793
Kozo, hurry up!

932
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:26,508
- l'm off!
- l'm off, too!

933
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:43,525
What do you think is going on?

934
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:47,362
They talked, didn't they, those two?

935
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:49,990
l wonder what's happened

936
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:52,409
Listen, Mrs Tomizawa!

937
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:55,537
What is it?

938
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:58,749
Hello

939
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:02,002
- What is it?
- Listen...

940
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:06,173
Those two Hayashi boys were
so cheerful this morning. Very odd...

941
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:09,551
Yes. They both said, "Good morning"

942
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:12,679
Oh, you've got them all wrong

943
01:29:12,805 --> 01:29:16,767
That family is so nice,
and Mrs Hayashi's very understanding

944
01:29:18,019 --> 01:29:21,980
- You think so?
- Yes, you're reading her wrong

945
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:26,109
l'm going into town. Need anything?
Okay, then

946
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:34,493
What do you make of her, then?

947
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:40,290
l guess the Hayashi must've bought
a hot plate or something

948
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:44,336
You're probably right.
She's a calculating woman

949
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:56,139
You still eating pumice stone?

950
01:29:57,934 --> 01:30:00,227
lt's bad for you. You'll die

951
01:30:02,605 --> 01:30:06,066
l've stopped and switched to burdock

952
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:07,651
Nudge me

953
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:13,824
Now me

954
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:17,702
Your turn

955
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:24,501
Rubbish. You're still no good

956
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:32,467
What's the matter?

957
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:37,097
l have to go home

958
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:46,189
l'll come on later

959
01:31:22,059 --> 01:31:23,602
Good morning

960
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:26,646
- Good morning. Thanks for yesterday
- Not at all

961
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:29,649
Where to?

962
01:31:29,775 --> 01:31:33,069
- To West Ginza
- Then we can go together

963
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:40,994
- Lovely day, isn't it?
- lt really is

964
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:43,914
lt's beautiful

965
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:49,419
lt looks like this nice weather will continue

966
01:31:49,545 --> 01:31:51,004
Yes

967
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:54,799
lt does look that way

968
01:31:56,302 --> 01:31:58,637
That cloud's an interesting shape

969
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:04,809
You're right, it is an interesting shape

970
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:06,853
lt sort of looks like something

971
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:09,105
Yes, like something

972
01:32:11,817 --> 01:32:13,360
Such a lovely day

973
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:19,282
Yes, a really lovely day

974
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:36,132
You're such a fool

975
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:38,093
And at your age, too

976
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,513
What a nuisance

977
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:47,352
Mum, l won't die, will l?

978
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:49,646
l swallowed pumice stone by mistake

979
01:32:50,773 --> 01:32:54,234
You'd be better offdead,
being absent from school for this

980
01:32:56,445 --> 01:33:00,115
l won't feed you till you're well.
You hear me?

981
01:33:02,868 --> 01:33:06,830
Mum, can l have some clean underwear?

982
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:12,002
You can go without.
You're not wearing any until you're better

983
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:45,327
The End
