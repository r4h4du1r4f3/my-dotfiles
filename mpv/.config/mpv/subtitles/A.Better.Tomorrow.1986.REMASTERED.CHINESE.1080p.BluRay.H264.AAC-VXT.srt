1
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,733
Kit!

2
00:01:28,316 --> 00:01:29,191
Kit!

3
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:00,441
-Two Hong Kong dollars?
-Yes.

4
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:09,483
-Mark.
-I'm coming.

5
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:16,441
You forgot the plate.

6
00:02:16,816 --> 00:02:17,650
Hurry.

7
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:22,275
Sir.

8
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:27,441
Tastes good?

9
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:28,441
Are you all right?

10
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:37,483
Take it and go to the doctor.

11
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:38,483
Thanks.

12
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:50,983
You can read it?

13
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:54,025
What?

14
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:55,941
Stop pretending.

15
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:11,775
Good.

16
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:13,358
Your English has improved.

17
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:15,066
You know how to say, "Of course."

18
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:20,650
-Good morning, Mark.
-Good morning, Mr. Sung.

19
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:21,775
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

20
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:24,025
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

21
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:26,608
-Good morning, Mr. Sung.
-Mr. Sung.

22
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:29,525
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Mr. Mark.

23
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:31,316
"Mr. Mark." I like that.

24
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:36,066
Mr. Yiu.

25
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,525
-Ho, you're back. Is everything okay?
-Yes.

26
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,566
-I did the counting already.
-Smart.

27
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,816
Those foreigners are easy-going.

28
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:44,025
Not all of them are as nice as they seem.

29
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:46,775
You believe in people too easily.

30
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:48,525
Thanks.

31
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,191
You are Shing? Have a seat.

32
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:52,191
Thanks, but I'll be fine standing.

33
00:06:57,191 --> 00:06:58,275
Good morning, Linda.

34
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,483
What a waste.

35
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:10,025
Shing, you can learn a lot from Ho.

36
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:11,650
He's a good lad.

37
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:15,441
But I'll never be as good as him.

38
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:19,025
Mark might be flirtatious,

39
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:20,400
but he is loyal.

40
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,275
Yes, he takes good care of me.

41
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:25,025
-What were you talking about?
-Nothing. We were just talking about you.

42
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,858
Really?

43
00:07:27,816 --> 00:07:29,775
Your brother, Kit, is graduating today.

44
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:32,358
Oh, right!

45
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,608
I forgot to buy him a present.

46
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:36,025
I've got to go now.

47
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,775
Ho.

48
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:42,025
Take Shing with you to Taiwan tomorrow.

49
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:44,191
Give the kid a chance.

50
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,358
We're going to Taiwan.
You think it's Chai Wan?

51
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:52,233
I've been in this business for years,
but Taiwan still scares me shitless.

52
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:54,900
Let me tell you why.
The fighting is insane, the drinking too.

53
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,650
Don't fool with him.

54
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:57,566
Yes.

55
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,150
Give Kit a hooker as a graduation present.

56
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:01,941
I'm no good,
but I want him to be a good citizen.

57
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:03,275
It's better than a booty call.

58
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:07,066
I want to be there when he gets his PhD,

59
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:08,566
when he gets married...

60
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:10,691
...and when he gets a baby.

61
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:12,358
You'll have to work hard then,
like a buffalo.

62
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:16,608
It's said that those with a big mouth

63
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:18,400
will step on shit
when they get in the elevator.

64
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:19,358
Please.

65
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:25,025
-No, you first!
-No!

66
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:26,066
Let's get in together.

67
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,191
Don't move! I'm a cop.

68
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,525
-Let me search you.
-Sir.

69
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:48,441
Freeze.

70
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:50,275
-That's not funny.
-Face the wall.

71
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:51,608
We both have guns.

72
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:54,150
If you don't respect me,
I won't respect you either.

73
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,816
Let's see who's got more respect, then...

74
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:02,775
You're so ticklish.

75
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,025
Don't...

76
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,358
Please...

77
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:06,358
Are you sure?

78
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:07,483
I have some good news, Ho.

79
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:09,483
You'll be surprised.

80
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:10,983
I'm an inspector now.

81
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:13,358
Surprise!

82
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:17,191
You have to work hard, then.

83
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:19,150
You need to become a superintendent.

84
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:21,650
Jackie.

85
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:24,150
She's my girlfriend.
She takes care of Dad when she has time.

86
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:25,608
My brother.

87
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:32,025
She's taking care of Dad this way.

88
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:39,066
-Thank you.
-No problem.

89
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:41,233
I've got to go to an interview.

90
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,150
A new girlfriend again?

91
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:46,066
So you're serious this time?

92
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,691
Let's see how she performs at night...

93
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:51,066
You said you'll come with me.

94
00:09:51,816 --> 00:09:52,858
Hurry up.

95
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:55,650
I really want to pick up Dad, but...

96
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:56,900
Oh, please. Stop it. Go.

97
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:58,608
-I'm really going, then.
-Go on.

98
00:09:59,066 --> 00:09:59,941
Sorry.

99
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:02,233
-Let's go.
-Quick.

100
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:12,941
Ho.

101
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:14,108
Dad.

102
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:16,025
You should quit.

103
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:19,650
Your brother doesn't know
what you have been doing.

104
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:22,775
I still remember that

105
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:25,316
you used to play Cops and Robbers
where you were little.

106
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,733
Even if your brother lost the game,

107
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:29,525
he still begged you
to let him play as the cop.

108
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:33,775
I don't want you to play
that game with your brother.

109
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:37,608
I beg you, quit this game for him.

110
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:41,566
Please?

111
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,233
Okay.

112
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:57,108
That's better.

113
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:59,316
I'm sorry for being late.
The traffic was so bad.

114
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,983
-Yes! The traffic was awful.
-I am Jackie.

115
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:02,733
-Sir, the traffic was bad.
-Please let me play.

116
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:03,775
Please let her play.

117
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:06,483
Are you okay? Be careful, you're pregnant.

118
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:07,816
-That's right.
-I'm fine.

119
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,441
Please believe me,
the traffic was terrible.

120
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:11,691
-Would you give her a chance, please?
-Fine, okay.

121
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:13,566
He said yes. Get on the stage!

122
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:22,108
How could they do that to you?
A pregnant woman?

123
00:11:22,191 --> 00:11:24,150
Listen, judges.

124
00:11:56,358 --> 00:11:57,233
Sorry.

125
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:04,400
You made me look like a fool on stage.

126
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:06,316
You are useless.

127
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:09,150
How can I help you
when you don't believe in yourself?

128
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,650
They didn't say you're out.
How do you know you're doomed?

129
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,900
-Give it back to me.
-Let go!

130
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:19,275
I am really doomed this time.

131
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:30,983
You've made up your mind?

132
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,816
This will be my last deal.

133
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:41,150
Because of Kit?

134
00:12:47,525 --> 00:12:49,858
Don't come with me to Taiwan tomorrow.

135
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:52,900
I need you to take care of things
in Hong Kong, in case anything goes wrong.

136
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,441
You'll be responsible for our men
from now on.

137
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:01,608
I can't handle it.

138
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:04,650
Let Shing do it.

139
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:06,275
He looks just like Al Pacino.

140
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:07,650
Don't fool with me, Mr. Mark.

141
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,233
Mr. Ho, we are nothing without you.

142
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,233
I still have a lot to learn from you.

143
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:14,441
It's not about what we want.

144
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:19,025
Reading books about the underworld
doesn't make you a boss.

145
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,483
Have you had a gun pointed at your head?

146
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:26,358
I bet not.

147
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,025
Twelve years ago...

148
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:32,066
It's 12 years, right?

149
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:36,275
Twelve years ago, Ho and I went
to Indonesia for the first time.

150
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,233
We had dinner with them in a nightclub.

151
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:45,358
I said something wrong.

152
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,775
Before I knew it,
two guns were pointed at me

153
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:51,108
and I was demanded to drink
a whole bottle of whiskey.

154
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:56,191
I was so scared that I wet myself.

155
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:00,275
Ho had my back.

156
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,066
He drank the whole bottle for me.

157
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:06,566
But things took a sharp turn.

158
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,150
Four guns were pointed at me after that.

159
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,483
Do you know what they asked me to drink?

160
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:16,983
Urine.

161
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:22,525
They asked me to drink urine in a club.

162
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:38,483
That's what I call learning from a pro.

163
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:51,816
That was our first deal.

164
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,525
What's past is past.
Don't talk about it anymore.

165
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:56,858
I must continue.

166
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,983
I have never cried since I was a kid.

167
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,775
That was the first time I cried.

168
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,483
I swore that I would never let anyone
point a gun at me again.

169
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,275
See? I can fight!

170
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:54,983
Be careful.

171
00:15:57,816 --> 00:15:59,233
You need to hit the sandbag more often.

172
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:03,066
I'm leaving tomorrow.

173
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:08,858
Going somewhere again?

174
00:16:10,691 --> 00:16:11,650
I'll be back soon.

175
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:16,650
Take care of Dad when I am away.

176
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,483
I will.

177
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:21,941
Take care.

178
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,025
Yes.

179
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,691
They're coming.

180
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:19,983
Be careful. Something's wrong.

181
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,066
How do you know?

182
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:24,483
Intuition.

183
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,566
-Mr. Sung, we've been waiting for you.
-Where's Mr. Wang?

184
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,441
He's not feeling well. I'm his nephew.

185
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:36,650
He asked me to go for him.

186
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:37,650
It's nice to meet you.

187
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:38,858
How ill is he?

188
00:17:39,816 --> 00:17:43,025
Mr. Sung, let's go in and talk.

189
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:44,233
It's nothing serious.

190
00:17:44,316 --> 00:17:46,858
He's just hiding out for a while.

191
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,191
Have a seat. Come.

192
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,233
Thanks.

193
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:50,900
Mr. Sung, this way, please.

194
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:53,441
When you get old,
you'll be scared of everything.

195
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:54,733
Please, have a seat.

196
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,733
Let's get straight to business.

197
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:58,650
Attention, headquarters.

198
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:02,066
Please look up a car.
Plate number, Taipei 1086379.

199
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,941
It might be associated
with suspicious activities.

200
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,191
We know you're reliable,

201
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:15,941
I respected you when I was a kid.

202
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:17,816
Can you believe it?

203
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,316
Someone paid me double to kill you.

204
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:23,191
He's crazy. I would never do that.

205
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:24,858
I'll give you the money now.

206
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:46,150
The police are here.

207
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:46,066
Hello.

208
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:53,900
Uncle.

209
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,483
Sung killed some of our men in Taiwan.

210
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:30,483
He is now wanted by the police.

211
00:20:31,025 --> 00:20:33,108
The boss is worried that Ho
might expose our secret.

212
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,566
Please come with me.

213
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:37,483
I don't want to hurt you.

214
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:43,983
You son of a bitch.

215
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:45,483
If you hurt my son,

216
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:46,733
I won't let you off.

217
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:48,650
Run!

218
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:49,608
Stop!

219
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:50,816
No!

220
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,858
Don't push me.

221
00:21:00,316 --> 00:21:01,733
-Hello?
<i>-Hey, Ling...</i>

222
00:21:01,816 --> 00:21:03,025
Wrong number.

223
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:10,983
Let's run, Uncle!

224
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,316
Uncle!

225
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,358
Jackie, what's happening?

226
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:11,566
Be careful, Kit.

227
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:13,483
Dad, don't come out.

228
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,983
-Dad, stay where you are.
-I'll kill you.

229
00:22:51,316 --> 00:22:52,775
-Stop!
-Die.

230
00:23:08,775 --> 00:23:09,650
Dad.

231
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:12,441
Dad.

232
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,483
Dad.

233
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:17,608
Kit...

234
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:22,066
Please forgive your brother...

235
00:23:50,483 --> 00:23:51,483
Who betrayed me?

236
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:58,483
Is it you?

237
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,691
Ho, if I had betrayed you,

238
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,775
I wouldn't be here with you right now.

239
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:10,816
I might not make it out alive this time.

240
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:31,441
Ho, what are you doing?

241
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:32,441
Ho.

242
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:34,775
-I need to turn myself in.
-Ho. Don't go.

243
00:24:34,858 --> 00:24:36,150
Please don't.

244
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:37,858
Please don't go outside.

245
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:44,525
No, Ho. Please don't.

246
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,566
Stay away from me.

247
00:24:50,066 --> 00:24:50,983
Ho...

248
00:24:51,066 --> 00:24:51,983
Go away.

249
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:54,191
I don't want to drag another person
into this.

250
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:56,733
-I heard gunshots in the cavern.
-Go!

251
00:24:56,816 --> 00:24:57,650
Run!

252
00:24:57,733 --> 00:24:58,566
No.

253
00:24:58,691 --> 00:24:59,900
Run, it's an order!

254
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:10,066
Stand. Don't move.

255
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:11,650
Put down the gun.

256
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:14,816
Did you hear me? Put down your gun.

257
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:59,025
COUNTERFEIT MONEY SMUGGLERS
OPEN FIRE AT EACH OTHER

258
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:13,816
<i>Loyalty is a thing of the past.</i>

259
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:16,525
<i>You can't trust anyone these days.</i>

260
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:19,816
<i>Even my nephew, Wang,</i>

261
00:26:20,233 --> 00:26:21,566
<i>betrayed me.</i>

262
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:24,816
<i>He teamed up with a new gang
from Hong Kong </i>

263
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:27,608
<i>and tried to take over my business.</i>

264
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:31,441
We sacrificed Ho.

265
00:26:35,025 --> 00:26:37,775
We respect a faithful man,

266
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:40,108
but not a traitor.

267
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:44,400
Hello.

268
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:46,566
Yes.

269
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,983
He will be in the Fung Lim Restaurant
tonight.

270
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:57,358
What are you going to do?

271
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,316
Do you need any help?

272
00:26:59,858 --> 00:27:01,191
Do you need my men?

273
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:08,650
Take care.

274
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,733
Thanks.

275
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:19,108
FONG LAM KOK

276
00:29:52,316 --> 00:29:53,650
-Chief.
-What's this?

277
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:55,775
-Chief. In here.
-Chief.

278
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:06,691
{\an8}I'm not scared.

279
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,650
My boss will post bail for me.

280
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,900
If you have the guts,
fight with me without a gun.

281
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:13,733
Let's see who is stronger?

282
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:17,941
5703.

283
00:31:18,858 --> 00:31:19,816
Sir, what's happening?

284
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:21,775
Nothing.

285
00:31:31,191 --> 00:31:32,191
Sung, what's the charge?

286
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,650
Drug trafficking, attacking the police.

287
00:31:35,275 --> 00:31:36,650
How dare you insult Inspector Sung!

288
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:37,733
Take down his statement.

289
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:41,233
Thanks.

290
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,733
Why is that?

291
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:59,275
This feels different.

292
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:01,275
Can I give you a lift?

293
00:32:01,691 --> 00:32:03,316
No, thanks. We are not going the same way.

294
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,858
I admire you.

295
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,900
You kept quiet because of your friends.

296
00:32:10,358 --> 00:32:12,150
That's ridiculous. You were behind bars.

297
00:32:12,483 --> 00:32:14,441
The counterfeiting business
is still going strong.

298
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:17,108
Thanks.

299
00:32:19,525 --> 00:32:21,025
I'm not involved anymore.

300
00:32:26,816 --> 00:32:28,066
Tell your friends.

301
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:30,191
The case is still open.

302
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:31,900
I won't let him off.

303
00:32:35,108 --> 00:32:36,150
A bad guy for a day

304
00:32:36,316 --> 00:32:37,691
will never be a good guy again.

305
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:42,358
Bye.

306
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:44,816
I'll never come back.

307
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,900
JIANG SU

308
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,358
GRAVE OF SUNG GONG JING

309
00:33:31,108 --> 00:33:31,983
Stop!

310
00:34:02,483 --> 00:34:03,816
Kit, calm down.

311
00:34:12,275 --> 00:34:13,233
Stop fighting.

312
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:24,775
Kit, stop.

313
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,608
Don't let me see you again.

314
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,275
Manager!

315
00:35:29,108 --> 00:35:30,650
Get to work.

316
00:35:33,775 --> 00:35:34,941
There's no manager here.

317
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,733
I'm Ken. Are you looking for me?

318
00:35:38,566 --> 00:35:41,941
Mr. Chung asked me to come see you.

319
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,025
-When I was doing business in Taiwan...
-Doing business? You were in jail.

320
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:52,025
Mr. Chung asked me
to give you this letter.

321
00:35:55,108 --> 00:35:57,275
Chung, he never does anything good.

322
00:35:57,733 --> 00:35:59,816
But we are friends.

323
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:03,108
It's so difficult
for an ex-con to get a job.

324
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:06,108
No one will hire an ex-con.

325
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:13,275
-Don't feel depressed.
-Right.

326
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:16,275
All these guys were prisoners before.

327
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:19,691
Doing business? That's a piece of cake.

328
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:22,025
Some people like adopting orphans,

329
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:24,275
I like taking care of ex-cons.

330
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,858
It's because I was in prison, too.

331
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:36,816
Everybody, here's the new guy.

332
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,191
Take care of him.

333
00:36:38,316 --> 00:36:40,316
He is... You are...

334
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Sung Tse Ho.

335
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:42,858
Mr. Ho.

336
00:36:43,316 --> 00:36:46,233
-Just call me Ho.
-Mr. Ho.

337
00:36:47,858 --> 00:36:49,983
A social gathering?

338
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,816
Back to work.

339
00:36:52,816 --> 00:36:54,191
I'm not paying you to do nothing.

340
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:57,608
-Do you have a driver's license?
-No.

341
00:36:58,566 --> 00:37:00,650
Whether you pass the exam or not,

342
00:37:01,108 --> 00:37:02,608
you can stay.

343
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:04,150
Thanks, Ken.

344
00:37:04,316 --> 00:37:05,816
Don't mention it.

345
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,025
There's no boss here.

346
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:21,108
-Take this for your lunch.
-Thanks.

347
00:39:10,191 --> 00:39:11,191
Mark.

348
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:24,941
This isn't what you told me
in your letter.

349
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:58,191
Mark, even if I break my legs,

350
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,566
I won't be able to repay you.

351
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:07,025
It's not your fault.

352
00:40:13,733 --> 00:40:14,941
I'm so glad to see you again.

353
00:40:16,733 --> 00:40:17,858
I haven't seen you for so long.

354
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:19,900
You still look the same.

355
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:24,900
Mark.

356
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:27,441
This isn't our world anymore.

357
00:40:28,566 --> 00:40:29,691
Why are you still here?

358
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,775
I've waited for you for three years.

359
00:40:48,775 --> 00:40:49,816
Let's start all over again.

360
00:41:09,983 --> 00:41:10,941
Don't bother me.

361
00:41:13,483 --> 00:41:14,566
Pay attention to your brother.

362
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,733
He's following Shing every day.
It's very dangerous.

363
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,358
You're brothers.

364
00:41:34,316 --> 00:41:36,650
Kit, we all know you are good at your job.

365
00:41:38,025 --> 00:41:39,441
I recommended your promotion,

366
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,900
but it was rejected.

367
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,358
Why?

368
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:53,066
This guy, you know him very well.

369
00:41:57,525 --> 00:41:59,066
He disappeared three years ago.

370
00:42:00,025 --> 00:42:01,900
He's back after being released
from prison in Taiwan.

371
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:04,150
He got back with his old partners.

372
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:05,608
It's none of my business.

373
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,900
We're investigating underworld activities

374
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:12,358
and none of their family members
have a connection.

375
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,816
Understand?

376
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:20,566
Whenever I carried out the tasks,

377
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:23,358
I've never thought of my brother.

378
00:42:25,316 --> 00:42:26,191
Kit.

379
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:29,608
You're not on Shing's case anymore.

380
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,358
Or else you'll spoil everything.

381
00:42:38,775 --> 00:42:40,525
Sung, Shing will meet the Thai tonight...

382
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:41,525
Nam.

383
00:42:49,816 --> 00:42:53,150
-Bottoms up.
-Men, let's all drink.

384
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:54,941
Mark. Tell us your stories.

385
00:42:55,025 --> 00:42:56,025
Let Ho tell them.

386
00:42:56,108 --> 00:42:58,941
My boss says it's 18 million
Hong Kong dollars, maximum.

387
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:00,441
Okay.

388
00:43:00,525 --> 00:43:01,775
Boss, Ho is outside.

389
00:43:05,691 --> 00:43:06,733
Draught beer, please.

390
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:16,108
This way, please.

391
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,066
Ho.

392
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,941
How come you didn't tell us you're back?

393
00:43:26,025 --> 00:43:27,066
You shouldn't do that.

394
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:33,733
We were good brothers once.
Is that right, Mark?

395
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:41,941
Ho, if you didn't take care of me,

396
00:43:42,025 --> 00:43:43,316
I would never have what I have now.

397
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:45,441
Oh, no.

398
00:43:46,775 --> 00:43:49,150
You deserve it.

399
00:43:49,233 --> 00:43:50,316
I don't have the ability.

400
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:51,941
Mark gave me the chance.

401
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:55,233
Mark, if you need my help in the future,

402
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:56,483
just say so.

403
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:59,191
Don't talk bullshit. Let's drink.

404
00:43:59,275 --> 00:44:00,816
You have to take care of our brothers.

405
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:03,691
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

406
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,066
This is for my leg.

407
00:44:24,858 --> 00:44:26,816
Come see me when you're free.

408
00:44:27,275 --> 00:44:28,441
There's a lot we can talk about.

409
00:44:28,525 --> 00:44:29,441
I'm not interested.

410
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:31,441
You will be.

411
00:44:32,733 --> 00:44:33,775
I have to go.

412
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:43,358
Sung Tse Ho.

413
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:46,858
Follow me.

414
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,900
What are you doing?

415
00:45:03,733 --> 00:45:04,983
What did Shing tell you?

416
00:45:05,983 --> 00:45:06,858
Bullshit.

417
00:45:07,483 --> 00:45:08,608
Don't fool me!

418
00:45:09,108 --> 00:45:10,650
Was it business or bullshit?

419
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:12,275
It was bullshit, really.

420
00:45:12,525 --> 00:45:14,025
Is there something arriving the day after?

421
00:45:14,316 --> 00:45:15,150
I don't know.

422
00:45:15,233 --> 00:45:16,900
Where to load and when?

423
00:45:17,525 --> 00:45:18,441
I don't know.

424
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:22,233
How can you be a boss and know nothing?

425
00:45:24,816 --> 00:45:25,775
Kit!

426
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:29,066
Don't call me Kit, call me inspector!

427
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,650
I'm not a boss anymore.

428
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,441
Where do you work?

429
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,900
United Taxi.

430
00:45:58,566 --> 00:45:59,566
It's a decent business.

431
00:46:03,108 --> 00:46:04,316
You rob people in a taxi?

432
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,358
Where do you live?

433
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:10,358
United Taxi.

434
00:46:12,566 --> 00:46:14,191
So someone still accepted you, thief.

435
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,275
"Thief." Doesn't he have a name?

436
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,441
Don't think you are great
just because you have a gun.

437
00:46:20,525 --> 00:46:22,150
I'll shoot you down, cripple.

438
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:29,191
Don't point your gun at my head.

439
00:46:29,983 --> 00:46:31,441
If you have the guts,

440
00:46:32,233 --> 00:46:33,941
shoot me!

441
00:46:35,483 --> 00:46:36,441
Kit.

442
00:46:36,858 --> 00:46:39,941
Sir, I know I owe you too much.

443
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:42,150
Give me a chance.

444
00:46:42,983 --> 00:46:44,066
Give you a chance?

445
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,441
I begged you to give me one.

446
00:46:48,191 --> 00:46:49,358
Do you know that, because of you,

447
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,108
I lost my chance at a promotion?

448
00:46:52,191 --> 00:46:53,733
It's because you are a member
of the triad.

449
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,400
Don't leave Hong Kong.

450
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:06,816
I'll be back to get you.

451
00:48:00,025 --> 00:48:01,858
Do you need an invitation
for a cup of tea?

452
00:48:02,525 --> 00:48:04,316
-Thanks!
-Thanks!

453
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,525
I will deduct it from your salary.

454
00:48:06,608 --> 00:48:07,941
You are mean.

455
00:48:08,025 --> 00:48:09,400
Otherwise, how can I support my family?

456
00:48:09,483 --> 00:48:10,566
-You're right.
-That's mine.

457
00:48:12,233 --> 00:48:13,150
Thanks.

458
00:48:13,233 --> 00:48:14,150
Hey.

459
00:48:14,775 --> 00:48:16,900
There's a beautiful girl staring at you.

460
00:48:25,525 --> 00:48:26,525
Please, come in.

461
00:48:27,025 --> 00:48:27,900
No.

462
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,358
I want your help.

463
00:48:34,066 --> 00:48:35,566
Can you leave Hong Kong for a while?

464
00:48:37,858 --> 00:48:40,066
I don't want to see Kit get mad.

465
00:48:40,441 --> 00:48:41,608
He can't take this pressure,

466
00:48:42,858 --> 00:48:44,108
and neither can I.

467
00:48:46,941 --> 00:48:50,191
I think it's better for you
to be away for a while.

468
00:48:51,066 --> 00:48:51,983
I won't leave.

469
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,108
I want Kit to see me living a new life.

470
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:00,275
Can you give me a chance

471
00:49:00,525 --> 00:49:01,816
to show it to him?

472
00:49:08,316 --> 00:49:10,108
Don't you see that I want to skate

473
00:49:11,025 --> 00:49:13,316
and ride a bicycle with him, too?

474
00:49:14,858 --> 00:49:16,108
I don't want to lose him.

475
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,483
-Ho.
-Ho.

476
00:49:27,483 --> 00:49:29,191
Don't stay here, go in.

477
00:49:30,316 --> 00:49:31,691
It's useless to stay here.

478
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,775
Ho can handle this. Go in.

479
00:49:38,733 --> 00:49:39,900
Who are they?

480
00:49:40,608 --> 00:49:41,566
Not good.

481
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,525
Ho, the boss wants to see you.

482
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:45,316
I'm busy.

483
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:46,858
Don't embarrass me.

484
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,066
Just come with us.

485
00:49:53,275 --> 00:49:55,608
-Hello?
-<i>Ho, Mark is with us.</i>

486
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:56,733
<i>Come over as well.</i>

487
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:59,858
No, thanks. I am not interested.

488
00:50:00,525 --> 00:50:02,233
<i>You may not be interested in the business,</i>

489
00:50:02,441 --> 00:50:04,566
<i>but what about your brother?
Doesn't he interest you?</i>

490
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:05,816
<i>I'll be waiting for you.</i>

491
00:50:07,108 --> 00:50:08,066
Okay.

492
00:50:09,775 --> 00:50:11,150
Ken, I want to go out for a while.

493
00:50:12,691 --> 00:50:14,483
You have to have a principle.
Don't be afraid.

494
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,025
Be good.

495
00:50:20,691 --> 00:50:22,608
Ho, please.

496
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,775
You'll never be clean
once you've belonged to the underworld.

497
00:50:58,066 --> 00:50:58,900
Ho.

498
00:50:58,983 --> 00:50:59,816
Ho.

499
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:03,150
Ho, I'm so glad you're back.

500
00:51:03,858 --> 00:51:05,025
How are you, Mr. Yiu?

501
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,025
Fine, thanks.

502
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:09,566
Come, talk to Shing.

503
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:12,733
Not you?

504
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:16,191
It's the same as talking to Shing.

505
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:20,066
I'm too old to make decisions.

506
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:22,400
Ho, please sit.

507
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:26,441
We can make big money.

508
00:51:27,025 --> 00:51:28,608
I really hope to work with you again.

509
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:31,400
How?

510
00:51:31,983 --> 00:51:33,233
You're still our boss.

511
00:51:33,525 --> 00:51:35,150
Mark handles the trafficking of money.

512
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:39,566
I'll take care of the drugs
and make money for our company.

513
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:42,691
We need you to contact the old clients.

514
00:51:45,025 --> 00:51:46,358
You haven't gotten to the point yet.

515
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:52,025
And with your brother's assistance,
it will be perfect.

516
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,775
What's better than having
your own man in the police?

517
00:51:59,025 --> 00:52:00,566
Come, I have something to tell you.

518
00:52:11,191 --> 00:52:12,608
How about I don't accept?

519
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,233
Ho,

520
00:52:16,358 --> 00:52:18,108
I kept Mark because of you.

521
00:52:20,108 --> 00:52:22,441
Your brother is following everything.

522
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:25,941
If it wasn't for you,
he'd be dead already.

523
00:52:29,025 --> 00:52:29,900
Shing,

524
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:34,316
one is my brother, the other is my friend.

525
00:52:34,733 --> 00:52:37,233
How could I walk out this door
if I said yes?

526
00:52:39,316 --> 00:52:40,733
I don't care if you insult me,

527
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,483
but don't insult my friend.

528
00:52:51,108 --> 00:52:52,608
If you hurt my brother,

529
00:52:53,691 --> 00:52:55,191
you won't live for long.

530
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,191
We've wanted Mark Lee

531
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:29,650
for three years,

532
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,816
but we can't take him back legally.

533
00:53:33,316 --> 00:53:34,275
Otherwise,

534
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,191
we can control the syndicate.

535
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:46,816
We've gotten some information recently.

536
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:50,775
In two days, there will be
counterfeit money

537
00:53:51,191 --> 00:53:52,775
and 500kg of heroin shipped to Taiwan.

538
00:53:53,691 --> 00:53:55,566
Though I can't do this case myself,

539
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,400
I hope to see
Mark and his men charged with it.

540
00:54:07,066 --> 00:54:08,691
Boss, Ho is too much.

541
00:54:08,775 --> 00:54:09,775
Let's kill him.

542
00:54:10,858 --> 00:54:13,275
That's not necessary.

543
00:54:24,025 --> 00:54:25,150
Just do as we've planned.

544
00:54:34,941 --> 00:54:37,233
I gave you the money already.

545
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,191
Where do we load the thing?

546
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:42,983
I'll give you the address.

547
00:54:48,275 --> 00:54:49,400
-Get in.
-We'll continue inside.

548
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,316
Welcome back.

549
00:55:02,191 --> 00:55:03,233
Did you have dinner yet?

550
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,358
What are you doing?

551
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:46,858
Mr. Mok, it's Kit.
I've got some information.

552
00:55:47,191 --> 00:55:48,983
The Thai will deal with Shing tomorrow.

553
00:55:49,275 --> 00:55:51,608
The time and location should be...

554
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:54,983
<i>Okay, hand in the information tomorrow
and don't concern yourself with this.</i>

555
00:55:55,066 --> 00:55:55,900
Why?

556
00:55:55,983 --> 00:55:57,066
<i>You are not involved.</i>

557
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,691
<i>I'm afraid that
you'll spoil the whole thing.</i>

558
00:55:59,691 --> 00:56:00,941
Give me a chance.

559
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,566
<i>I have told you
that there is no hero in the police.</i>

560
00:56:03,775 --> 00:56:04,733
<i>What are you doing now?</i>

561
00:56:31,816 --> 00:56:33,525
Do you know that today is my birthday?

562
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,650
Can you look at me?

563
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:05,525
You'll look at the vase.

564
00:57:05,733 --> 00:57:07,483
This is your home,
not the police barracks.

565
00:57:09,941 --> 00:57:12,941
You even forgot my birthday.

566
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,233
Jackie.

567
00:57:36,608 --> 00:57:37,525
I didn't forget.

568
00:57:51,025 --> 00:57:52,983
Blow out the candles.

569
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:07,816
What wish did you make?

570
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,316
You really want to know?

571
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,441
What is it?

572
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,566
Promise not to get angry.

573
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,025
Say it.

574
00:58:16,525 --> 00:58:18,775
A reunion between the two of you.

575
00:58:26,816 --> 00:58:27,983
Don't be angry.

576
00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:29,525
I won't.

577
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:33,108
Don't get angry on my birthday.

578
00:58:33,733 --> 00:58:35,733
I won't let you get angry.

579
00:58:35,816 --> 00:58:37,150
Otherwise, I will get angry.

580
00:58:37,816 --> 00:58:38,691
Smile.

581
00:58:42,483 --> 00:58:43,483
I'll get it.

582
00:58:51,025 --> 00:58:52,025
Did something happen?

583
00:58:55,108 --> 00:58:56,275
I want to speak to Kit.

584
00:59:02,066 --> 00:59:02,941
Who is it?

585
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,983
Don't be mad.

586
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:07,150
Keep your promise.

587
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:21,775
Sit.

588
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:22,858
Thanks.

589
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
Today is your birthday?

590
00:59:24,483 --> 00:59:25,400
Yes.

591
00:59:26,066 --> 00:59:27,066
Have some cake.

592
00:59:27,191 --> 00:59:28,316
Why do you treat him that well?

593
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,650
Don't do that.

594
00:59:33,525 --> 00:59:36,566
I don't care how you treat me.

595
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:39,191
I'm here to tell you something.

596
00:59:39,816 --> 00:59:41,400
Shing is trying to trap you.

597
00:59:41,816 --> 00:59:43,108
Be careful.

598
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:44,858
Thank you.

599
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,691
Don't trust those scum.

600
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,816
It's always going to be a trap

601
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:52,066
if you have it too easy.

602
00:59:53,733 --> 00:59:55,608
Do you think I am as dumb as before?

603
00:59:55,983 --> 00:59:58,358
I only want to help you.

604
00:59:58,441 --> 00:59:59,441
Help me or trick me?

605
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,691
Do you know that I'm burdened
because of you?

606
01:00:07,025 --> 01:00:08,400
Can't you trust me for one last time?

607
01:00:09,191 --> 01:00:13,025
-Trust you? That's how I lost Dad.
-Kit.

608
01:00:19,108 --> 01:00:20,025
Jackie!

609
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,400
Ho.

610
01:00:24,691 --> 01:00:27,691
His impression of me didn't change a bit.

611
01:00:28,733 --> 01:00:31,733
Don't give up.

612
01:00:31,858 --> 01:00:33,275
Don't let him look down on you.

613
01:00:39,441 --> 01:00:40,983
<i>Why can't you forgive him?</i>

614
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:42,775
Let him start a new life?

615
01:00:42,858 --> 01:00:44,316
Because he killed Dad indirectly!

616
01:00:45,566 --> 01:00:47,150
Why are you forcing me to accept him?

617
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:55,650
He can't blame anyone
for choosing the wrong way.

618
01:01:04,025 --> 01:01:07,025
I'm the cop. He's the thief.

619
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:13,483
We're going in opposite directions.

620
01:01:57,108 --> 01:01:58,025
I'm a cop.

621
01:02:08,816 --> 01:02:09,983
What's happening? Ken!

622
01:02:10,108 --> 01:02:12,108
<i>Your brother is having an operation.</i>

623
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:16,191
<i>He's now at Queen Margaret's. Hurry up!</i>

624
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,191
Okay.

625
01:02:23,775 --> 01:02:25,150
What happened to my brother?

626
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:26,691
He was trapped by Shing.

627
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:28,150
He did it on purpose.

628
01:02:29,566 --> 01:02:30,441
How is he?

629
01:02:30,733 --> 01:02:31,900
You can't get in.

630
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,358
I tried to stop him,

631
01:03:14,483 --> 01:03:15,525
but he insisted.

632
01:03:16,316 --> 01:03:17,733
I hope you can cooperate with the police

633
01:03:17,858 --> 01:03:19,483
and inform us of your location.

634
01:04:10,775 --> 01:04:12,025
It's easy to be a hero.

635
01:04:13,275 --> 01:04:14,108
Jump.

636
01:04:16,233 --> 01:04:18,900
It's not the same.
Now, you don't have any choice.

637
01:04:19,983 --> 01:04:21,275
Cooperate with us.

638
01:04:22,566 --> 01:04:23,941
Don't tell the police.

639
01:04:24,233 --> 01:04:25,733
We know each other well.

640
01:04:50,025 --> 01:04:52,108
What are you doing?

641
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,316
Hey!

642
01:04:59,941 --> 01:05:01,025
What's happening?

643
01:05:06,983 --> 01:05:08,691
Don't use Sung ever again.

644
01:05:15,483 --> 01:05:16,608
Stop!

645
01:05:28,733 --> 01:05:29,650
Beat them up!

646
01:05:46,816 --> 01:05:47,650
Stop it!

647
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:49,191
Let's talk it over.

648
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:51,816
Stop fighting!

649
01:05:52,233 --> 01:05:54,900
It's not worth it to break the law again.

650
01:06:08,316 --> 01:06:09,191
Stop fighting!

651
01:06:12,066 --> 01:06:12,941
Stop!

652
01:06:17,025 --> 01:06:18,441
Run!

653
01:06:18,566 --> 01:06:21,025
You idiot. Don't go!

654
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,025
Stay if you have the guts!

655
01:06:25,691 --> 01:06:26,733
You son of a bitch!

656
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:31,150
Ken. This is my fault.

657
01:06:31,941 --> 01:06:33,275
I don't want you to be involved.

658
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:36,858
You have no principle.

659
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:38,900
They fight because they are scared.

660
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:42,066
If you fight back, they win.

661
01:06:48,566 --> 01:06:50,233
Why do you want to change?

662
01:06:50,316 --> 01:06:51,233
Why?

663
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,483
Who is he?

664
01:06:54,816 --> 01:06:56,108
Ken! Ho!

665
01:06:56,233 --> 01:06:57,275
Come and have a look.

666
01:06:57,358 --> 01:06:58,483
Come over here.

667
01:06:58,566 --> 01:06:59,483
Mark!

668
01:07:01,316 --> 01:07:02,316
-Mark!
-He's hurt.

669
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,233
Mark!

670
01:07:05,316 --> 01:07:06,941
The first aid kit.

671
01:07:07,108 --> 01:07:09,275
-Quick!
-Get me the first aid kit!

672
01:07:15,066 --> 01:07:16,108
Ken, what are we going to do?

673
01:07:18,316 --> 01:07:19,650
Let's go!

674
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,775
Go!

675
01:07:41,608 --> 01:07:43,233
Police. Stop. We're going to search you.

676
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:50,233
That's too much.

677
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,191
I'll send the quotation to the station.

678
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,066
Smart.

679
01:07:54,941 --> 01:07:56,608
Hurry.

680
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:19,900
I didn't notice that Hong Kong
is so beautiful at night.

681
01:08:23,525 --> 01:08:25,358
But it doesn't last.

682
01:08:26,483 --> 01:08:27,525
It's not worthwhile.

683
01:08:35,066 --> 01:08:35,900
Ho.

684
01:08:36,858 --> 01:08:37,816
Let's start all over again.

685
01:08:38,983 --> 01:08:40,066
After this,

686
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,775
let's leave Hong Kong gloriously.

687
01:08:43,316 --> 01:08:44,150
Mark.

688
01:08:44,233 --> 01:08:45,691
We've never been scared before.

689
01:08:46,775 --> 01:08:48,108
Why are we scared of Shing?

690
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:51,525
Don't push me.
I'll never get involved again.

691
01:08:57,358 --> 01:08:59,983
That was the past.

692
01:09:00,233 --> 01:09:02,941
I'm still alive.

693
01:09:04,233 --> 01:09:06,858
Even if you do this ten times,
a hundred times...

694
01:09:07,066 --> 01:09:07,983
What then?

695
01:09:08,066 --> 01:09:09,691
Even if you kill Shing?

696
01:09:17,316 --> 01:09:18,566
I lost my brother already.

697
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,775
I don't want to lose you, too.

698
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:23,900
Mark, why don't you wake up?

699
01:09:23,983 --> 01:09:26,441
I don't want any sympathy.

700
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:30,900
You didn't owe me anything?

701
01:09:31,941 --> 01:09:33,941
I've never forced my friends
to do things unwillingly.

702
01:09:34,983 --> 01:09:36,191
I have my principles.

703
01:09:36,858 --> 01:09:38,733
I don't want to be a loser
for my entire life.

704
01:09:40,733 --> 01:09:42,150
Do you think I like begging?

705
01:09:44,483 --> 01:09:46,941
I've waited for a chance for three years.

706
01:09:48,066 --> 01:09:50,525
I have to show them that,
though I may not be the best,

707
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:53,150
I will take back whatever I've lost!

708
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:06,191
What do you think you look like?

709
01:10:08,233 --> 01:10:09,608
We were scared when we were bad.

710
01:10:10,108 --> 01:10:12,983
Now, we feel as if we are being followed
when we are good.

711
01:10:14,191 --> 01:10:15,525
Did you fight for a chance?

712
01:10:17,025 --> 01:10:17,900
You didn't.

713
01:10:18,816 --> 01:10:19,775
You didn't!

714
01:10:24,608 --> 01:10:26,358
I don't want to be like you.

715
01:10:30,525 --> 01:10:31,400
Mark.

716
01:11:00,858 --> 01:11:01,983
What happened to you?

717
01:11:03,108 --> 01:11:04,358
I just want to take something back.

718
01:11:21,525 --> 01:11:22,441
Stand on that side.

719
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:24,150
Go and get the plate.

720
01:11:24,483 --> 01:11:26,358
You'll be in big trouble.

721
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:28,941
-Think twice before you do it.
-Stop.

722
01:11:36,108 --> 01:11:36,983
Stop for a moment.

723
01:11:48,733 --> 01:11:49,566
Run.

724
01:11:49,775 --> 01:11:50,650
Open the door.

725
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:53,566
Thanks, Mr. Chan.

726
01:11:54,483 --> 01:11:56,108
Go after them!

727
01:13:45,108 --> 01:13:46,441
You idiot!

728
01:13:47,066 --> 01:13:48,441
I told you, that's too much.

729
01:13:49,275 --> 01:13:50,483
Idiot.

730
01:13:50,816 --> 01:13:53,608
If Ho hands the plate to the police,

731
01:13:53,691 --> 01:13:54,858
not only will you die,

732
01:13:54,941 --> 01:13:56,608
but the syndicate will also collapse.

733
01:13:56,691 --> 01:13:59,150
That's enough. Don't call me an idiot.

734
01:13:59,358 --> 01:14:01,108
What did you call me
when I made money for you?

735
01:14:01,816 --> 01:14:03,108
I regret having you.

736
01:14:03,566 --> 01:14:06,316
I'll kill you if you don't
bring me back the plate.

737
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:07,525
Kill me, then.

738
01:14:07,858 --> 01:14:09,608
I betrayed Ho three years ago.

739
01:14:10,233 --> 01:14:11,608
Would I be scared of him now?

740
01:14:15,983 --> 01:14:17,316
You have to pay him back.

741
01:14:17,566 --> 01:14:20,441
We have to share this problem together.

742
01:14:27,525 --> 01:14:28,441
Hello.

743
01:14:29,983 --> 01:14:32,983
Ho, why did you give me such a problem?

744
01:14:33,066 --> 01:14:34,775
Mr. Yiu, I want to speak to Shing.

745
01:14:35,108 --> 01:14:37,483
<i>Shing? Wait a minute.</i>

746
01:14:38,566 --> 01:14:42,358
Beg him to give us back the plate.

747
01:14:45,025 --> 01:14:46,650
Ho, don't fool me.

748
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,066
We can make a compromise.

749
01:14:49,233 --> 01:14:52,066
At 10 p.m. tonight, go to the temple
with two million US dollars.

750
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:53,525
Exchange it for the plate.

751
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:56,066
<i>And have a boat ready for you at The Bay.</i>

752
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:57,400
It's that simple?

753
01:14:57,483 --> 01:14:58,316
I want cash.

754
01:14:59,275 --> 01:15:00,400
Bring it yourself.

755
01:15:00,525 --> 01:15:01,441
I will be there.

756
01:15:10,275 --> 01:15:11,941
<i>What did Ho say?</i>

757
01:15:12,775 --> 01:15:14,400
What did he say?

758
01:15:16,983 --> 01:15:17,941
What?

759
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:19,691
He said he wants to have dinner with you.

760
01:15:19,775 --> 01:15:21,400
Okay, I'll wait for him.

761
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:26,775
Sir.

762
01:15:27,441 --> 01:15:28,316
Sir.

763
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,066
Come in.

764
01:15:30,733 --> 01:15:32,191
Mr. Mok, I have some information.

765
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,358
Ho, Mark, and Shing had a quarrel.

766
01:15:34,441 --> 01:15:36,025
They blackmailed Shing.

767
01:15:36,108 --> 01:15:37,316
They have a deal tonight.

768
01:15:39,650 --> 01:15:40,816
Do you know the time and place?

769
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,941
Later.

770
01:15:43,858 --> 01:15:45,400
Hello. I'm...

771
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:48,566
Thanks.

772
01:15:50,566 --> 01:15:51,608
Two minutes ago,

773
01:15:51,691 --> 01:15:53,608
Shing withdrew two million US dollars
from the bank.

774
01:15:54,108 --> 01:15:56,358
Everyone, get ready for your orders.

775
01:15:57,983 --> 01:15:59,941
Mr. Mok. Let me join in.

776
01:16:00,441 --> 01:16:01,566
You should be in the hospital.

777
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:02,566
What are you doing here?

778
01:16:05,025 --> 01:16:07,483
I'm fine.

779
01:16:07,566 --> 01:16:08,941
You're on paid leave for a few days.

780
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:13,275
See, I can lift the chair easily.

781
01:16:13,691 --> 01:16:14,733
You're not on the case.

782
01:16:16,275 --> 01:16:18,066
My brother is the thief, not me.

783
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,983
Why do you pressure me?

784
01:16:22,066 --> 01:16:24,191
If you still remember the rules,
you shouldn't get involved.

785
01:16:24,275 --> 01:16:26,483
-My dad died three years ago.
-Your brother is the mastermind.

786
01:16:26,566 --> 01:16:28,108
-But you two are brothers.
-I know this case

787
01:16:28,191 --> 01:16:29,525
-very well.
-Don't pressure me.

788
01:16:29,816 --> 01:16:31,191
I want to lock him up myself!

789
01:16:32,858 --> 01:16:35,066
I'll lock him up.

790
01:16:37,858 --> 01:16:39,483
I'll lock him up!

791
01:16:43,275 --> 01:16:45,691
Kit. Be practical.

792
01:17:37,566 --> 01:17:38,441
Jackie.

793
01:17:44,816 --> 01:17:46,316
I'm leaving Hong Kong tonight.

794
01:17:47,983 --> 01:17:49,108
You are giving up.

795
01:17:50,525 --> 01:17:51,566
Can you give

796
01:17:51,691 --> 01:17:54,150
this packet to Kit tonight at nine?

797
01:17:54,941 --> 01:17:56,566
It's very important to him.

798
01:18:01,066 --> 01:18:02,275
Will you come back?

799
01:18:21,691 --> 01:18:24,025
Kit, your brother is leaving tonight.

800
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:26,108
He asked me to give this packet to you.

801
01:18:26,691 --> 01:18:29,483
<i>Kit. The plate I gave you</i>

802
01:18:29,691 --> 01:18:31,775
<i>is evidence to charge Shing.</i>

803
01:18:32,608 --> 01:18:34,983
<i>We have a deal tonight at The Bay.</i>

804
01:18:35,358 --> 01:18:37,816
<i>You can put me in prison if you want.</i>

805
01:18:38,316 --> 01:18:40,150
<i>I decided not to stay in Hong Kong.</i>

806
01:18:42,316 --> 01:18:44,358
What are you doing?

807
01:18:44,566 --> 01:18:45,566
I have to get him.

808
01:18:45,733 --> 01:18:46,900
No. You can't.

809
01:18:46,983 --> 01:18:48,400
-Let go.
-No.

810
01:18:48,483 --> 01:18:49,525
Go away!

811
01:18:51,191 --> 01:18:52,150
Kit...

812
01:18:54,025 --> 01:18:54,900
Kit...

813
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:07,900
Ho. They are late.

814
01:19:13,066 --> 01:19:14,233
Do you know what to say?

815
01:19:41,858 --> 01:19:42,900
Do you believe in the gods?

816
01:19:45,025 --> 01:19:47,150
I'm a god.

817
01:19:49,858 --> 01:19:50,941
God is human.

818
01:19:53,441 --> 01:19:55,316
Anyone can be a god
if he can control his fate.

819
01:19:57,358 --> 01:20:00,650
But sometimes you can't.

820
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:05,733
You'll either win or lose.

821
01:20:16,275 --> 01:20:17,150
Hold it.

822
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,316
The money?

823
01:20:24,316 --> 01:20:25,275
The plate?

824
01:20:25,983 --> 01:20:27,108
It was handed to the police.

825
01:20:33,983 --> 01:20:34,900
Don't.

826
01:20:36,108 --> 01:20:37,233
There's a bomb.

827
01:20:37,816 --> 01:20:39,191
I'm not dumb.

828
01:20:44,483 --> 01:20:45,400
Are you scared?

829
01:20:46,733 --> 01:20:48,025
How will you take me on, then?

830
01:21:26,608 --> 01:21:27,525
Shit!

831
01:21:27,733 --> 01:21:30,733
After Ho arrived,
he had a quarrel with Master.

832
01:21:30,816 --> 01:21:32,483
He asked for two million US dollars.

833
01:21:32,566 --> 01:21:34,150
He'll be at sea tonight.

834
01:21:34,233 --> 01:21:35,858
Then I heard a gunshot.

835
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:37,400
That's him.

836
01:21:38,275 --> 01:21:39,275
Are you sure?

837
01:21:39,441 --> 01:21:40,400
Yes.

838
01:21:40,775 --> 01:21:42,066
Do you want to be a witness?

839
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:43,150
Yes.

840
01:22:19,858 --> 01:22:21,566
I know you would do that already.

841
01:22:22,066 --> 01:22:23,191
You'll lose.

842
01:22:23,275 --> 01:22:24,233
Get out!

843
01:22:25,233 --> 01:22:26,150
Get out!

844
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:28,191
Get out!

845
01:22:29,233 --> 01:22:30,441
You'll let him go if you're smart.

846
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,400
Come over here.

847
01:22:36,816 --> 01:22:37,691
Go!

848
01:22:58,025 --> 01:22:58,900
Ho, on board.

849
01:23:00,066 --> 01:23:01,025
You go first.

850
01:23:03,775 --> 01:23:05,108
You said we'll go together.

851
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,525
I've got something to do.

852
01:23:13,191 --> 01:23:14,191
I'll meet up with you.

853
01:23:17,483 --> 01:23:18,316
Mark.

854
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:19,733
Go.

855
01:23:25,358 --> 01:23:26,316
I'll wait for you.

856
01:24:33,525 --> 01:24:35,566
Release him.
Otherwise, I'll kill your brother.

857
01:24:36,525 --> 01:24:37,441
Don't do it.

858
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:41,400
It's one for one.

859
01:24:49,275 --> 01:24:50,233
Go!

860
01:24:51,983 --> 01:24:53,316
-Go.
-Go!

861
01:25:12,275 --> 01:25:13,358
I won't let you off.

862
01:25:15,441 --> 01:25:16,358
I know.

863
01:25:29,275 --> 01:25:31,358
Kit!

864
01:27:39,941 --> 01:27:40,900
Come over here!

865
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:27,775
You.

866
01:29:30,441 --> 01:29:32,983
Look at your brother.

867
01:29:35,691 --> 01:29:36,858
Look!

868
01:29:41,608 --> 01:29:43,025
No matter how he has wronged you before,

869
01:29:43,233 --> 01:29:44,400
he has paid you back now.

870
01:29:50,233 --> 01:29:51,441
He has the guts to change.

871
01:29:52,441 --> 01:29:53,900
What can't you forgive him?

872
01:29:54,316 --> 01:29:55,275
Why?

873
01:30:01,233 --> 01:30:02,150
For a brother...

874
01:30:50,108 --> 01:30:51,483
-Shing!
-Ho!

875
01:31:22,108 --> 01:31:23,316
You can't go over there, miss.

876
01:31:25,733 --> 01:31:26,608
Shing!

877
01:31:33,025 --> 01:31:35,608
Ho, you're being surrounded.

878
01:31:36,025 --> 01:31:37,733
You have three minutes.

879
01:31:37,816 --> 01:31:39,358
Come out unarmed.

880
01:31:53,316 --> 01:31:54,233
No more bullets.

881
01:31:56,483 --> 01:31:57,608
I'm going to surrender.

882
01:31:58,358 --> 01:31:59,441
I'll be all right.

883
01:31:59,858 --> 01:32:00,858
But you won't.

884
01:32:02,691 --> 01:32:05,608
I will have money three days later.

885
01:32:05,691 --> 01:32:07,066
I'll be released.

886
01:32:07,733 --> 01:32:10,275
I have money.
I can change from black to white.

887
01:32:11,608 --> 01:32:13,858
I learned that from you.

888
01:32:14,358 --> 01:32:15,733
But your brother,

889
01:32:16,316 --> 01:32:18,483
because of you,
he's turned from white to black.

890
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:20,316
You've dragged him down.

891
01:33:30,858 --> 01:33:31,816
Kit.

892
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:34,858
You were not wrong.

893
01:33:35,275 --> 01:33:36,566
We just chose different paths.

894
01:33:38,066 --> 01:33:40,191
You went the right way.

895
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:49,983
I was wrong before.

896
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:55,275
I want to be back on the right path now.
