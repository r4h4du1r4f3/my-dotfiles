00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,789
Unit 2, get in position.

00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:08,577
Co-executive producer Mike im

8
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,289
ready to rappel down.

9
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,905
Block all passages. Go on my signal.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,207
Personal safety is priority.

11
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:17,414
Produced by Kim sung-hwan

12
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,157
go!

13
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,617
You dope head. When you
gonna kick that shit?

14
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:42,155
I had bloodwork done, dumb-ass.

15
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,809
If you got health problems, eat cabbage.

16
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,245
Don't shoot up.

17
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,746
Secondhand smoke ruined my health.
Open a damn window.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,117
Gambling doesn't kill gamblers.

19
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,948
Lung cancer does.

20
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:56,828
That fan over there?

21
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:57,997
Ever thought to use it?

22
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,873
Aw, shit... What the...
Dammit...

23
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:04,452
What was that?

24
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,910
What the hell... Who is it?

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,206
Just... hold on.

26
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:14,077
One second.

27
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,202
No cleaning kit.

28
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:19,581
So not a window cleaner. You a cop?

29
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:23,489
Good job. You get a sticker.

30
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,699
This is ridiculous.

31
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:30,365
Is busting a card game worth all this fuss?

32
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,744
You're sweet. I won't arrest you.

33
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,495
The rest of you, hands up!

34
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,198
I'm here for the dope head.

35
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:38,623
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

36
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,703
Let's go, hwan-dong. Almost dinner time.

37
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,323
Where you going? You gonna run?

38
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:45,453
I don't want dinner.

39
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,534
You know I'm on diet. I already ate.

40
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,490
We got all escape routes covered.

41
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,241
Guess who's behind door number 27?

42
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,367
For crying out loud...
He's not gonna come this way.

43
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,241
This is exciting. My first arrest!

44
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,412
That means this window's covered too?

45
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,375
Well, well.

46
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,575
Wait... where you going?

47
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:20,747
How do you stop this thing?

48
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,157
You partner with her?

49
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,331
Grab my hand!

50
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,655
This is pathetic.

51
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,365
If you rappel down,

52
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,073
you got to make a clean jump,

53
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,998
break through the
window, roll here,

54
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,830
pull your Baton,
and tackle your target

55
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:45,748
without taking any hits.

56
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,289
Then subdue the target,

57
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,870
slap on cuffs,
and read them their rights.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,615
Isn't that how it goes?

59
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,541
Our policy is to minimize property damage.

60
00:03:56,625 --> 00:04:01,289
I feel sorry for the cops in this country.
Where's the dignity?

61
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,331
People before money.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,036
That your bumper?

63
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:09,830
Yep.

64
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,999
You watch too many movies.

65
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,789
It doesn't work.

66
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:14,875
Really?

67
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,333
Go!

68
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,163
The suspect's getting away!

69
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,250
After him!

70
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,581
He was right! Shit!

71
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,743
Captain ko!

72
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,244
Go! Just go!

73
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:58,249
Hey! Stop!

74
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,243
You!

75
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,323
What the hell?

76
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,994
You piece of shit!

77
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,198
Hey! Stop!

78
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:04,118
Son of a bitch!

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,740
Perfect timing.

80
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:25,871
If you can't run fast
enough, find a fast ride.

81
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:29,284
You really should use
your brain once in a while.

82
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,871
I know it hurts.
Cuffs will make you feel better.

83
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,533
Now, where'd they go?

84
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,414
Throw me your cuffs.

85
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:45,958
Shit!

86
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,575
You caught a middle man
then nearly killed him.

87
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,573
Why didn't you just kill him?

88
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,787
You worried about breaking windows

89
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,786
but smashed up 16 cars.

90
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,366
That last car crashed deliberately.

91
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
It's true.

92
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,950
It already had a dented bumper. I saw it.

93
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,741
- Shut up.
- Total insurance fraud.

94
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,573
Whatta lowlife!

95
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,406
I said shut up.

96
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,491
It was only 15 cars. Did you get cctv?

97
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,948
I'll get that fraudster.

98
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:54,203
Shut up. Shut the hell up.

99
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:55,998
Let them ramble. It's funny.

100
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,163
Sorry, sir.

101
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,411
Oh... look at this.

102
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,871
You made a social media star.

103
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,118
Watch.

104
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:09,159
"Mrs. Kim" will now be synonymous
with "courageous civilian"

105
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,491
instead of "terrible driver".

106
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,369
That's incredible.

107
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,411
Think so?

108
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,332
I admire the optimism.

109
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,997
Captain ko.

110
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:22,947
Sir?

111
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:26,364
Aren't you tired of being captain?
I know I am.

112
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,412
Did you hear choi got his promotion?

113
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,911
But he's junior to our captain!

114
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,785
Shut your mouth.

115
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:39,163
While you were dangling from
a rope trying to catch small fish,

116
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,947
choi and his organized crime unit
reeled in evidence

117
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,116
for a major drug trafficking deal.

118
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,888
They even apprehended an entire
syndicate after 2 months undercover,

119
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,573
confiscating 2 kilograms of meth

120
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,783
and doing your job for you.

121
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,911
So where does that leave you?

122
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,283
Maybe you picked the wrong career...

123
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,905
Or maybe I should do the thinking for you,

124
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,574
you hopeless bunch of imbeciles!

125
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,997
With all due respect... Get out!

126
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,368
Go!

127
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,458
Out!

128
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,699
- Disappear!
- No need for violence.

129
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:16,998
Out! Out!

130
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,699
- Have a good day, sir.
- Get the hell out!

131
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,829
I swear I'm gonna quit but,

132
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,703
every morning I come in here.

133
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,373
Maybe I come to work to swear.

134
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,726
What's the point of working so hard
if we can't even eat properly?

135
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,957
And why is that?

136
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,954
Because you disappeared
with the squad budget.

137
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,643
I didn't disappear, I went undercover.

138
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:38,454
Pisses me off even thinking about it.

139
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,492
I'll give you a piece
of my mind, you thief!

140
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,365
Knock it off.

141
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,540
I'll handle the budget from now on.

142
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,161
- Frisk him.
- Got it.

143
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,490
I said knock it off.

144
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,120
- Get your hands off me.
- Sorry, sir.

145
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,452
Huh?

146
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,375
It's a chip.

147
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,785
A what?

148
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:58,868
A chip?

149
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:00,042
- A chip.
- What chip?

150
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,581
- Choco chip.
- Choco chip?

151
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,164
Yeah, choco chip.

152
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:04,327
Swallow.

153
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,990
Go on, do it.

154
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:15,746
I went undercover in a casino.
I had to blend in.

155
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:20,489
This isn't important.
About that fraudster...

156
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,120
You bastard...

157
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,451
We're short on money as it is!

158
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,789
Let go! I'll kill him!

159
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:30,498
Stop. Let him go.

160
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,365
Let go of me.

161
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:33,747
Get your hands off me.

162
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,368
Captain!

163
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,910
You talking to me?

164
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,327
Who else is here?

165
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,912
You should've told me if
you knew 2 months ago.

166
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,413
We could've collaborated.
Why didn't you say anything?

167
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,240
- I wanted to catch them.
- What?

168
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,119
I wanted to catch them myself.

169
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,166
You have a knack for
screwing up operations.

170
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,786
Remember the Chang case?

171
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,867
I said give it a month,
but you couldn't resist poking around.

172
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,415
I heard a transit bus
caught your perp today.

173
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,161
It was a village bus!

174
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,408
Better than a school bus.

175
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:13,282
We're outta here.

176
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,573
By the way, there's only one
captain here. I got promoted.

177
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,155
Aren't you gonna congratulate me?

178
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,619
Come join us for dinner.

179
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,661
We're having barbecue.

180
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,365
Keep it together.

181
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,415
Why don't you just eat it raw?

182
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,115
I like it rare.

183
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,038
Leave him alone.

184
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,582
The closest he's come to
beef is beef-flavored ramen.

185
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,157
Not a good flavor.

186
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,956
Do you have any self-respect?

187
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:08,784
Nope. This is awesome. Try it.

188
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:09,955
Yes, ma'am.

189
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,700
Can we get a bottle of jinro?

190
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:16,123
The $30 one?

191
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:20,499
More garlic too!

192
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,615
Keep your chin up.

193
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,993
Hurts my neck.

194
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:30,409
I wanna give you a tip, me to you.

195
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,748
2/f, no.7, Lane 9, changchung

196
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,868
if you catch mubae,

197
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,119
you'll hit it out of the park.

198
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,369
It won't get me anywhere.

199
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,948
Don't you want your promotion?

200
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,285
Shit...

201
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,947
Mubae's right hand man, Hong,
was released 6 months ago.

202
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:46,373
What was he in for?

203
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,072
Thuggery.

204
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,079
What's he gonna do now?

205
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:51,498
- Thuggery.
- Yep.

206
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,207
And what did he learn from mubae?

207
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,532
Life lessons?

208
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,740
- Dope trading.
- Bingo.

209
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:04,578
Leave a few bodies in his wake.

210
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:05,827
Believe me, I know.

211
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:06,917
Get to the point.

212
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,155
After cleaning up his turf, surprisingly...

213
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,577
He hasn't done a thing.

214
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,199
Should I be disappointed?

215
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:23,822
Listen...
He's recruited new faces.

216
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,948
Pushers and ex-cons.

217
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:30,328
He's putting together a gang.

218
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:31,417
What're they up to?

219
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,245
My gut says they're waiting

220
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:38,284
for mubae's return to Korea.

221
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,498
Why are you telling me this?

222
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,665
Offering you a break one bro to another.

223
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:46,204
My hands are full right now.

224
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,032
Narc picks up mubae.

225
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,662
We'll take Hong.

226
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,789
This is just between us.

227
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,825
Why? Lil bro is hurting your pride?

228
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,458
Then forget it.

229
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,582
You're not my bro.

230
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,119
You're a superior officer now.

231
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,746
You're not gonna tell him
he doesn't have to do that?

232
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,870
He's excited. I'm not
gonna ruin it for him.

233
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,082
Let him have some newbie fun.

234
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,745
We'll lay low til mubae surfaces.

235
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:53,327
Tell that to ma. He goes
around looking for trouble.

236
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:17,622
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let me come!

237
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,908
Can I come, too?

238
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:26,576
Hurry! We're running late.

239
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,789
Take a seat.

240
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:31,248
Let's go!

241
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,826
Our newbie's gonna build a house today.

242
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:44,578
They're quiet as a grave.

243
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,783
There's no telling when mubae will show.

244
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,116
Why don't we just go in?

245
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,414
I still have the gas man uniform.

246
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:55,532
I'll go in with young-ho.

247
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,616
I wanted to stop doing that.

248
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,665
They don't know us yet.
This is our best chance.

249
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,573
Huh?

250
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,780
I'm asking you for ID.

251
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:12,990
Well, we're actually...

252
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,539
P-I-e-e-s=

253
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,116
sorry? Say that again?

254
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:23,908
We're from mapo.

255
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:27,034
Okay, sir. You live in mapo.

256
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,120
But I need your ID, not your address.

257
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,539
Oh, come on!

258
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:34,739
Why the hell would we stalk this lady?

259
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,405
Then why were you watching me in secret?

260
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,661
With all due respect, I'm not that low.

261
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,409
Stay back, please.

262
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,912
You look exactly that low!

263
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,623
Creeps me out.

264
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,708
Say what?

265
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,740
I'll say what I see!

266
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,164
Please, ma'am. Calm down. Please.

267
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,457
You. Are. A. Stalker.

268
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,161
Okay, let's go.

269
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,910
Teach them a lesson!

270
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,322
We're surveying the
neighborhood for viability.

271
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:07,499
And you accuse us of stalking you?

272
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,789
Come on, let's just go.

273
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,494
On our way to the station.

274
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,663
Stop.

275
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,491
Knpa brother chicken.

276
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,333
Did you order more?

277
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:37,532
Man...

278
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,161
I wish this chicken was the perp.

279
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,411
We've had tons of this.

280
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:48,409
Can we order something hot?
I'm about to throw up.

281
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,617
Can we get some hot sauce?

282
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:52,622
Bah...

283
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:56,701
Why do we always pay for this
but of our own pockets?

284
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:00,538
Because of you.

285
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,082
You spent all our money.

286
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,954
Makes me wanna smash your skull.

287
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:06,947
Can I ask you something?

288
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,122
Don't.

289
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,455
Do you have a crush on me?

290
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:11,502
Yes. I am head over heels
in love with you, idiot!

291
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,447
Captain, this is pointless.

292
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,371
Ma blew his cover by stalking that lady,

293
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,495
and besides, staking out
here is unproductive.

294
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,368
We don't know when
mubae will-there he is!

295
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,577
That's him, right?

296
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,199
He's that good-looking?

297
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:40,658
Must have had a makeover.

298
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,750
Get down.

299
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:43,917
Dammit...

300
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,785
What are you doing?

301
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
One!

302
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:52,784
Two!

303
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:53,958
Three!

304
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:56,875
Four!

305
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,243
Shit...

306
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,241
What a curious bunch.

307
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,868
Here. This is on the house.

308
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,823
On the house? Why?

309
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,578
Because I feel like it.

310
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,414
And you look happy.

311
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:20,417
Shit!

312
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,829
We've got no time to waste.
We're switching to wiretap.

313
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,851
Not without a warrant.
This isn't an anti-communist op.

314
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,143
Choi and his organized crime unit
aren't getting this case.

315
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,934
Illegally obtained evidence
won't hold in court.

316
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:36,976
We need approval from chief.

317
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,706
Forget it. He doesn't have our back.

318
00:19:38,792 --> 00:19:40,282
If only for internal confirmation.

319
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,956
No one will know.

320
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,031
Captain,

321
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,768
tread carefully or you
could lose your pension.

322
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,518
Without it, we're no better than
part-time cashiers.

323
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:48,157
Lose our pension or lose our jobs.

324
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,976
I'll take full responsibility.
Get the wiretap.

325
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,080
So cool.

326
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,364
External wiretapping is made
to order and takes time.

327
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:57,124
I can get cams right away.

328
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,957
How are we gonna get
through that metal door?

329
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:02,042
Duck.

330
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,615
Sir, do you deliver?

331
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,661
What chicken joint doesn't?

332
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,583
Do you deliver to that building?

333
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,828
Do I deliver there?

334
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:18,907
It's the only place I get orders from.

335
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,080
We're in!

336
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:24,285
Excuse me. Can we deliver for you?

337
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,040
No wonder you've been on job sites all day.

338
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,740
You're looking for a new job.

339
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,286
I'm sorry, but I put
this place up for sale.

340
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:39,827
Today's my last day.

341
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:40,702
- What?
- You can't.

342
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:42,373
- Why not?
- You're asking me?

343
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:48,369
You're the only customers
I've had all week.

344
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,996
Why else would I give you free chicken?

345
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,664
We'll buy it.

346
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,493
Ow!

347
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,698
What the hell?

348
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:06,750
You can't buy the store...

349
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,121
It's not as absurd as it sounds.

350
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,768
What? You wanna sell chicken to pass time?

351
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,453
He said they're his only customers.

352
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,991
Have you seen anyone
walk in while we were here?

353
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:16,742
No.

354
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:17,833
How are we gonna buy it?

355
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,160
I'll put in a request.

356
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,740
- Think they'll approve?
- Hell no.

357
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,198
Then shut up.

358
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,866
I'm washing up. Decide
who's on night watch.

359
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,244
We need solid evidence to pin mubae.

360
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,120
It's absurd to lose him over money.

361
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:32,244
There's a lot of absurdity in what we do.

362
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:39,579
Special crime's captain Lee
will be promoted soon.

363
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:41,828
Another one?

364
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:44,954
Where does that leave our captain?

365
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:47,499
Years from retirement
with no place to stand.

366
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:49,498
I'll buy the business.

367
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,324
I've been saving for my wedding,

368
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:56,035
but for the captain's sake,
I'll get married in the next life.

369
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,535
Forgive me, mother!

370
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:01,285
I'm not married yet either.

371
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,871
Don't lose hope. Let us pray.

372
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,115
Dear lord...

373
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,375
Our newbie, jae-hoon...

374
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,698
Fix me some supper.

375
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,657
Gucci...

376
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:29,917
Chicken...

377
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,410
What?

378
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:35,364
It's fine. I can do it.

379
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,742
Captain choi's wife called.

380
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:43,125
We used to hang out a lot.

381
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,367
She wants to treat me to lunch.

382
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:50,746
Should I treat her like
your boss' wife from now on?

383
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:53,787
Even the community sup
gets promoted after a while.

384
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:57,072
I don't go to the new supermarket

385
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,290
because it's called "captain mart".

386
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:06,159
Because he's been playing
captain for 20 years.

387
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:09,325
Captain, captain, captain...
I can't stand the word!

388
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:10,782
Mom, they made me student captain!

389
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,581
Don't do it! Don't do it!

390
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:13,782
No! No! No!

391
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,956
Is it good?

392
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,241
Fried chicken's always good.

393
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,950
My teacher calls chicken
common people food.

394
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:30,538
I hope the price doesn't go up
so we can still get it.

395
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,661
Hey, dad can afford that much.

396
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,240
Have some then.

397
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,575
Nah, I'll pass.

398
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,828
Is work tough?

399
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,741
Only because I'm not capable.

400
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:48,746
You can't be a captain
if you're not capable.

401
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:52,954
It takes more than hard
work to be a captain.

402
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:55,207
More than anything, you need money.

403
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:57,292
Money for what?

404
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,787
You got to treat people from time to time.

405
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,833
And if we're short on
money, I got to chip in.

406
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,915
30 bucks? Really?

407
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,869
Have you heard of the anti-graft law?

408
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:28,496
Civil servants cannot exchange
more than $30 at a time.

409
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:32,117
You think I'm made of money?

410
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:35,166
How can I back a squad
that produces no results?

411
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,957
But you can't send me to admin.

412
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:39,907
The captain of that team is ma's peer.

413
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,241
I'll transfer both of you.

414
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:43,458
That's even worse.

415
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
And that changes what?

416
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:48,165
Chief, you put this team together.

417
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,367
Now I'm disbanding it myself.

418
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,117
Sir... What?

419
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:54,660
You know me.

420
00:24:56,792 --> 00:25:00,034
I honestly don't know if I do anymore.

421
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,658
It's not like my chicken isn't tasty.

422
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,786
It's got to be bad Karma.

423
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,161
You've fried your share of chicken.
Just let it go.

424
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,037
Maybe I'll try selling plants or trees.

425
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:13,167
Where do I sign?

426
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,786
What's the matter with you?

427
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:18,993
Mr. Kim, give us a few days.

428
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,664
We'll take over.

429
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,160
With what money?

430
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:26,497
I'm selling cheap,
and you jobless bums still can't afford it.

431
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:29,450
We're not bums! We're...

432
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:32,205
You're... what?

433
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:33,417
Huh?

434
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,223
- Brothers and sisters.
- Brothers-in-law.

435
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,786
What are you saying?

436
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,038
That's right.

437
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,912
These two are brothers,
and these two are married.

438
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,115
I see.

439
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:47,245
We want to run it as a family. Help us out.

440
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,199
You should at least put down a deposit.

441
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,449
You can't just badger.

442
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:05,159
It's good if a family works together.

443
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,073
You're right. I'm her husband.

444
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:12,118
Huh?!

445
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,208
What?

446
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:15,957
She said she's married to that guy.

447
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:19,542
I meant ex.

448
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:23,369
- How American.
- Uh-huh.

449
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,868
Like in those Hollywood movies.

450
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,617
Exactly.

451
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:26,708
Wow.

452
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,574
Okay, well...

453
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,125
Yes.

454
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:37,490
- See you later.
- Yeah, sure.

455
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,539
- Bye.
- Take care.

456
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:40,660
Thank you.

457
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:44,453
You okay? Using your
retirement fund for this?

458
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:49,039
If we don't catch mubae, I got to quit
and open a chicken joint anyway.

459
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,616
I'll just say I started early.

460
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,991
My ex rocks!

461
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:57,208
No one goes home after today.

462
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:21,990
Young-ho?

463
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,990
We're closed for reopening.

464
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,740
Come in, come in.

465
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:53,740
I thought there were no customers!

466
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:56,034
We had 9 tables... 13

467
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:58,832
13 damn tables!
And not the ones we're waiting for!

468
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:01,073
Maybe it's beginner's luck.

469
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:03,374
Who's frying the chicken?

470
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,206
Because people are gonna order it.

471
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:08,489
Don't be retarded.
We'll order from somewhere else.

472
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,785
Ahhh...

473
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:12,434
We don't know how long
we'll need to do this

474
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,164
but we can't keep turning customers way.

475
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,865
Our cover will be blown for sure.

476
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,285
Let's just sell chicken.

477
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:18,989
Shut up.

478
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:19,663
I'd better, right?

479
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,457
Why are they so damn quiet?

480
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,827
Anything recorded today?

481
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:26,579
Just tons of guzzling and TV.

482
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,032
They got it easy.

483
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:29,292
Did they go anywhere?

484
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,205
To the supermarket.

485
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,292
What did they get?

486
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,163
Chicken breasts.

487
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,741
Are they trying to be healthy dope heads?

488
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,073
Motherfucker!

489
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,125
Lock the door.

490
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:47,035
The boss said don't make trouble.
Why you getting all worked up?

491
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,539
You in love with me or something?

492
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:51,745
Didn't we decide we'll have
the remote on odd days?

493
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:54,537
And we'll have it on even.

494
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:58,288
Then watch YouTube or some shit

495
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,242
instead of flipping channels on my day.

496
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:05,906
It was a commercial.
I wanted to see what else was on.

497
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:11,495
Yeah, but it starts small then gets bigger.

498
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,910
Think we don't know that?

499
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,240
What did you say?

500
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,240
You want a pretty smile for your face?

501
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,324
You begging for a Chelsea grin?

502
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,123
They're good with words.

503
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:22,824
You're obviously blind.
How about I give you a Lasik surgery?

504
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:25,415
- Pretty entertaining.
- Scrape out your eyes with a spork.

505
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,197
How do you talk sense to a junkie?

506
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:30,998
We're narcos, you fucking thug!

507
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:34,621
Narcs, you lousy scum!

508
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:39,247
You poison society to take
home 6 figures and fancy cars.

509
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,619
Because we live in a world

510
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,164
where skills are valued.

511
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,242
Wanna see the skills I got with my blade?

512
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,413
You syndicate types

513
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:49,824
pretend it's all about honor,

514
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:52,033
but you take thousands in hazard pay.

515
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,241
Thousands?

516
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,665
We don't make near that.

517
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:00,906
What are you doing?

518
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,448
Bringing them in.

519
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:03,542
For what?

520
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,750
For...

521
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:06,781
Slander?

522
00:30:06,917 --> 00:30:08,202
Against who?

523
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:10,072
Our profession?

524
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:11,498
You'll fine them for that?

525
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,456
Why'd they go quiet?

526
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:17,703
Was it so hard to keep your mouths shut?

527
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:18,992
- It's Hong.
- That's him.

528
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,746
Tired of watching TV?

529
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,449
Of voting for your favorite contestant?

530
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,785
Stick your heads out.

531
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,115
This'll take all day.

532
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:39,332
Hit yourselves til you get at least 2 cuts.

533
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,956
Seems rational.

534
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,954
Enough. Warmed up yet?

535
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,913
Back in the day, we had
fist fights to rank ourselves.

536
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,083
Remember?

537
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:53,328
Let's see who's number 1 now.

538
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,581
Take off your shirts.

539
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:05,748
Ready...

540
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:07,782
Go!

541
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:14,950
They're at it again.

542
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:17,411
Their punches are really loud.

543
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,874
Playground fighting is louder.

544
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,658
Come on, Hong. Commentate.

545
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:39,081
Stop.

546
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:41,824
Who won? Which side?

547
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:47,077
Narcs! Narcs! Narcs! Narcs!

548
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,956
Are you ready to hear the winner?

549
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:50,667
The narcs/.

550
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,785
We won!

551
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:04,036
- Losers buy chicken.
- Yes, sir.

552
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,125
Unlatch the door.

553
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:07,578
Get some take-out.

554
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:09,684
Shit! Lock the door. Turn off the lights.

555
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:10,823
Damn.

556
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:14,791
Are you the new owners?

557
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:17,454
You can't leave your trash out front.

558
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,366
Omigod! It's you people again.

559
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:23,244
9,1, 1

560
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:25,451
hello?

561
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:26,702
Wait, wait!

562
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:29,874
We took over this restaurant.

563
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,822
That's why you've been lurking around.

564
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:36,829
I totally misunderstood.

565
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,949
I'll buy some chicken,
as a gesture of goodwill.

566
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:44,706
Bring me your best.

567
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:48,620
Well...
We don't have chicken... yet.

568
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,323
No chicken in a chicken restaurant?

569
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:54,285
Unfortunately, no. We just opened so...

570
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:59,329
The boys from upstairs
have come for chicken too.

571
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:01,414
They have no chicken today.

572
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:02,618
What a shame.

573
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:07,292
Here.

574
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,375
Who's doing the frying?

575
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:09,914
Come on, are you serious?

576
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,036
I said come back and
they said they'd come back.

577
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,456
He meant it too.

578
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:15,658
There's no point if
they're getting take out.

579
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,790
We can forget the garnish,

580
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:19,867
then take it later, enter the venue,

581
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,038
and recon the inside.

582
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,786
Or we could deliver free chicken.

583
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,661
He's right. We can treat them.

584
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,537
Ma, start frying.

585
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:29,708
You're from suwon,
the birthplace of fried chicken.

586
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:32,454
It's actually the birthplace of ribs.

587
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:35,367
Ma's folks run a rib restaurant in suwon.

588
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:36,288
You know nothing.

589
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,331
Then you do it, jang.

590
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,208
- Yes.
- Really?

591
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:40,955
Yeah.

592
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:45,411
Do you remember the stew she made?
The one that tasted like poop?

593
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,244
I remember. I can't forget.

594
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:50,531
Then you do it.

595
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:51,825
I'm a surveillance specialist.

596
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:54,783
I'm from a patriarchal family.
I've never even been in a kitchen.

597
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,952
I'll marry in my next life...
Screw you.

598
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,623
Alright. Everyone does it!

599
00:33:58,875 --> 00:33:59,875
Go! Fry!

600
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:00,622
But I really...

601
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,573
I don't care. Get in the kitchen.

602
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,161
That doesn't even look cooked.

603
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:39,495
What the hell? Did you do this on purpose?

604
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:41,702
Urgh.

605
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,744
Why's this good? Whose is this?

606
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:52,542
Mine.

607
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,119
Notta chance.

608
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:03,032
No shit.

609
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,831
You're insane.

610
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:06,615
Succulent.

611
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:08,039
Alright! The verdict is in.

612
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:11,697
Congratulations, ma.

613
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:16,833
Give it your best.

614
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:17,910
Wait.

615
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:19,372
Give it my best?

616
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:20,948
For what?

617
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,083
Are you open?

618
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:43,121
It was perfect. Just do the same again.

619
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,331
Can we get sticky chicken?

620
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:48,914
With sticky sauce?

621
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,663
I forgot there are two
types of fried chicken.

622
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:56,121
The only sauce I know is marinade for ribs,
our family recipe.

623
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:59,415
That'll do. Get on it.

624
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:29,831
Interesting seasoning.

625
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:31,373
What's this chicken called?

626
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,616
It's called...

627
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,619
Suwon rib marinade chicken.

628
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:39,494
Suwon rib marinade chicken?

629
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:49,748
Oh god!

630
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,948
Wow!

631
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:51,997
This is so good.

632
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:54,449
This has become my favorite place.

633
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:58,366
- So yummy.
- Let's get a picture.

634
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,368
We got it. We got it.

635
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:03,994
Alright! Nailed it.

636
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:08,906
Okay.

637
00:37:09,042 --> 00:37:09,952
♪ Suwonribmarinadechicken

638
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:11,823
ready... say chicken.

639
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,123
Chicken!

640
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,948
- Can we get a soju?
- Yes.

641
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:17,122
Okay.

642
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:21,452
What?

643
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,160
One half-and-half.

644
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:24,372
Jae-hoon.

645
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:28,907
Coming right up.

646
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,868
Two people? Come on in.

647
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:42,155
Choosing good failure
over inglorious success

648
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,289
would be an honorable thing,

649
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:48,405
but honey, I'm not ashamed.

650
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:51,036
You went through a lot for me.

651
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:53,999
Now, let your hair down and enjoy.

652
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,208
We'll go to nice places.
We'll live a little.

653
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,947
Because you deserve it.

654
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,785
Chicken is the future.

655
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,661
Suwon rib marinade chicken.

656
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:09,698
Jae-hoon. Jae-hoon?

657
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,289
Can you get radish and salt?

658
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,368
I got to mince garlic after this.

659
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,824
You should've done that earlier.

660
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:18,659
This is so not professional.

661
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:24,118
Actually, my real job is...
What?!

662
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,206
- Check, please.
- Yes.

663
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:27,202
Just a moment.

664
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:28,702
It's $88.

665
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,616
Out of 90...

666
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:35,539
- $2 is your change. Thank you.
- Thank you.

667
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37,081
Can I get a coke?

668
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:38,743
Coming right up.

669
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,874
Young-ho, come inside and
get radish and salt.

670
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:50,453
Can I get some dinner?

671
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,206
Wow, Gucci... agh!

672
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,083
What's that?

673
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,535
You said you wanted one.

674
00:38:58,167 --> 00:39:02,661
But it's too expensive.

675
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,197
I got a bonus at work.

676
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:13,827
Give me a second.

677
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:16,123
Let me take a quick shower.

678
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,664
Honey?

679
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,365
What do you mean by that?

680
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:25,623
Why are you taking a shower?

681
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:31,239
We're not some crooked show.
We don't ask for money.

682
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:35,166
We don't hire fake customers.

683
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,244
It's 100% real.

684
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,790
So you want our restaurant
to be on your show?

685
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:42,491
Not just the restaurant,
but you, your wife,

686
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:45,040
and the chef...

687
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:47,749
We're gonna put everyone on national TV.

688
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:50,697
There's a step!

689
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:51,577
Don't push!

690
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:52,497
Good bye.

691
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:56,246
We have high ratings.
We'll do you good, I promise.

692
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,157
He humiliated me.

693
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:01,415
A national TV producer!

694
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:03,993
What a shame.

695
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:07,739
My folks ran their restaurant for
30 years and were never on TV.

696
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:12,200
We can't be on TV. We're undercover cops.

697
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:14,999
We can ask them to blur out our faces.

698
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:16,243
What?!

699
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:19,993
Come to think of it...

700
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:23,871
What the hell?! Get your act together!

701
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,661
Are we here to fry chicken?

702
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:29,239
Did you forget who you really are
while cooking and wiping tables?

703
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:33,747
Let's turn in our resignation
and do this for real, dumbasses.

704
00:40:37,042 --> 00:40:39,784
Chicken never tasted so good.
Is this really chicken?

705
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,795
Thank you for calling
suwon rib marinade chicken.

706
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:45,291
A group of 307? Certainly.

707
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:46,583
Thank you.

708
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:56,122
I get diarrhea just thinking
about chicken now. Geez...

709
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:03,038
What the...?

710
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:06,907
Dammit.

711
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:11,203
Possible c-1 sighting.
Possible c-1 sighting.

712
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:16,657
Hello?

713
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:17,958
Excuse me?

714
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,160
Coming.

715
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,580
I'm coming, I'm coming.

716
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:21,667
Excuse me?

717
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:24,327
Shit...

718
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,750
Yeah.

719
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,574
Pick up the damn phone.

720
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,333
Mubae!

721
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,160
What the...?

722
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,333
Huh?

723
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:15,708
Dammit.

724
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:21,990
Hey!

725
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,369
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?!

726
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,908
Get out of the car!

727
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:28,869
I'm sorry, okay?

728
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:36,369
Where have you been all day?

729
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:38,908
I could've used some help with the beer.

730
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,072
There are those who slack off
while others work their asses off.

731
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:44,533
Are you calling me a slacker?

732
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:48,079
Why didn't you answer the radio?

733
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:50,118
Or my call?!

734
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:51,744
It was pure madness!

735
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:53,953
I'm sitting down for the first time today.

736
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:56,829
Are you doing this as a cover

737
00:42:56,917 --> 00:42:59,704
or are you using undercover as an excuse?

738
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:01,331
Calm down, man.

739
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:02,452
Are you drunk?

740
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,330
Mubae was here.

741
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:05,823
- What?
- Mubae?

742
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:06,952
What happened?

743
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:09,998
I chased him. By myself.

744
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:13,785
In that shitty little
car of ours... Then.

745
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,865
I came to an intersection.

746
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,535
Which way did he go?

747
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:20,492
Left or right? North or south?

748
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:24,701
Do you know how frustrated I felt?

749
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:26,414
Do you?

750
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:30,999
The eternal dilemma of
fried or sticky chicken.

751
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:32,702
What happened?

752
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:34,282
What do you think? I lost him.

753
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:37,242
And you're proud of that?

754
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:40,218
You're not the only one
who had a tough day.

755
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:44,656
I got burned and cut.
Do you know how much that hurts?

756
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,742
A lot! Still very hurts.

757
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:51,364
Instead of chopping down criminals,

758
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:54,575
I'm chopping chicken all day!

759
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:57,283
Who here has peeled 4 sacks of onions,

760
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,661
15kg of garlic, and 33
bundles of green onions?

761
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:02,624
Every day is drilling.

762
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,414
2340

763
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,706
that's today's sales.

764
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:09,033
Suppose each table is $30.

765
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:12,322
Do you know how many tables
I served and wiped today?

766
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,036
Jesus...

767
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:23,822
That's my point.
We're not doing this to make money.

768
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,416
Why give it your best?

769
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:30,620
Why is business flourishing?

770
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:32,619
Damn this chicken!

771
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,288
How many times did I tell you
to recruit a middleman?

772
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:40,538
Ted Chang is going around
threatening everyone.

773
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:44,197
I'm threatening you now,
in case you weren't aware.

774
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:47,784
I'm sorry, but I found a guy I can trust.

775
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:50,412
Unfortunately, he was doing a one-off job

776
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:53,033
and got hit by a bus.

777
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:55,327
I almost laughed there.

778
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:58,165
The one guy you can trust had
to do a side job to survive.

779
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,990
Like I said, it's because of Chang...

780
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:02,074
Chang, Chang, Chang!

781
00:45:02,292 --> 00:45:04,203
You're having fun, aren't you?

782
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:06,533
Come here. Let's make it fun for me too.

783
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:07,785
Hong.

784
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:11,822
I told you not to carry that around.
It's unsightly.

785
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,248
Because of Chang...

786
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:18,031
Chang's the reason? Gimme that.

787
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:24,663
Hong.

788
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:25,750
Sir?

789
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,333
Get me some wet wipes.

790
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:28,375
Yes, sir.

791
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:35,785
That didn't scare you, did it?

792
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:38,073
Sun-hee...

793
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:41,494
Cut off his leg.

794
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:46,532
Sun-hee, wait!

795
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:47,702
Why my leg?!

796
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,323
Where should I begin?

797
00:45:57,542 --> 00:45:59,282
At the cut.

798
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:01,282
At the hemline for Capri pants.

799
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,240
Mubae! Sir! Please!

800
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,286
Please! Forgive me.

801
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:06,490
I'll do it right.

802
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:07,618
How?

803
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:13,079
Why don't we forget the
middleman and sell directly?

804
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:16,871
It's feasible with your capacity.

805
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:24,457
Chicken is common people food.

806
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:27,703
Surely, no one will pay this for chicken.

807
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,664
No one in their right mind.

808
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,331
Famous rib marinade - $36

809
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,581
one rib marinade for table 14.

810
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:41,573
Coming!

811
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:46,989
The plates were untraceable.
Want me to tail Hong?

812
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:49,119
Later. Later!

813
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:51,365
How many pints?

814
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,536
- Three.
- Gotcha.

815
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:57,851
Our chicken's famous now.
They're calling it "emperor's chicken".

816
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,661
People keep posting on their sns.

817
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:03,493
It's become a must-eat
for Japanese tourists.

818
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:06,995
Everyone, please come this way.

819
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:08,539
Welcome!

820
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:11,408
We only sell 50 chickens a day.

821
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:16,617
Saying they'd come back and
not coming back is very hurtful.

822
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,290
What do they think chicken is?

823
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:20,865
Seasonal delight?

824
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:22,789
You eat hot dogs in summer
and soup in winter.

825
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:24,240
Chicken's for every week!

826
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:24,913
Amen.

827
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,581
Let's knock on their door

828
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:27,934
and offer free chicken as an opening gift.

829
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:29,414
With beer and coke too.

830
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,643
We'll mix roofies into the drinks
and knock them out.

831
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:34,158
We can't wait any longer.

832
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:35,823
Let's just do it.

833
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:38,909
We can't drug them.
We're police for god's sake.

834
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,659
No.

835
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:42,495
You can't take the high road with them.

836
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:45,366
They're criminals. They commit crimes.

837
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:48,450
They haven't yet.
We could get arrested for this.

838
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,498
I'm already in a prison of oil and grease.

839
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:51,823
So slippery.

840
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:54,533
We never got approval for this.

841
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:57,161
What's stopping us now? I say drug them.

842
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:57,913
Alright!

843
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:58,701
Let's go.

844
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,999
I can't believe you.

845
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:03,244
- Jang! Ma!
- Sir?

846
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:08,199
How can you even think
that as experienced detectives?

847
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:10,707
We may be frying chicken, right now,

848
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:12,908
but we're still law enforcement.

849
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,243
If we behave like thugs,
what sets us apart from them?

850
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:18,664
Are you thugs?

851
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,110
If you're gonna do as they do,
at least make money like them

852
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:24,530
instead of your measly paychecks.

853
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:28,414
That didn't come out right...

854
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:30,748
What're you looking at?

855
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:33,830
Captain.

856
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:34,917
What?

857
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:36,581
Chief's on the phone.

858
00:48:37,458 --> 00:48:39,870
Are you following my orders

859
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,579
or screwing things up again?

860
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:45,082
We've been submitting reports.

861
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,125
About those... Look.

862
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,456
Stakeout.

863
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:52,083
Stakeout.

864
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:54,408
That's all you've been doing.

865
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,785
I can explain.

866
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:02,495
Stakeout... stakeout...

867
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,865
50 raw chickens?

868
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:07,831
What the hell is this?

869
00:49:07,917 --> 00:49:09,327
That's a mistake.

870
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:14,455
Listen.

871
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:20,831
I'll be straight with you.
In the upcoming reorganization,

872
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:26,539
the narcotics division will be disb...

873
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,373
Sorry.

874
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:34,288
Again.

875
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:39,823
Come restructuring,
the narcotics squad will be...

876
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:44,041
Just answer the damn thing already!

877
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:45,331
Excuse me.

878
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:52,280
Chicken never tasted so good.
Is this really chicken?

879
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:54,295
Thank you for calling
suwon rib marinade chicken.

880
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:55,823
Sorry?

881
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:57,868
Where?

882
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,244
Hey! Where are you going?

883
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:05,573
Where the hell are you going?

884
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:07,828
You idiots!

885
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:33,993
- Newbie.
- Sir.

886
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:36,039
- Cut the power on my signal.
- Yes, sir.

887
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:37,328
- Detective jang.
- Yes, sir.

888
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:39,616
Set up bugs in the office and hallway.

889
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:40,322
Yes, captain.

890
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:41,031
Young-ho.

891
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:42,498
Scan the interior.

892
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:44,995
I'll divert their attention by
stalling with the card reader.

893
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,226
In and out within one minute.

894
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:46,864
Yes, sir!

895
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,573
In case of emergency,

896
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:49,577
ma and I will go in as backup.

897
00:50:49,667 --> 00:50:50,667
I'm coming too.

898
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:56,697
It's done already?

899
00:50:56,792 --> 00:50:59,374
It's urgent, so I got to it.

900
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,456
Chicken never tasted so good.

901
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:20,414
Oh, that?

902
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,036
It's on its way now.

903
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:14,948
What took you so long?

904
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:20,246
Hey, chicken's here. Let's eat.

905
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:21,197
Okay.

906
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:24,159
Where'd everyone go?

907
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:25,292
What?

908
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,831
They moved out today.

909
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:27,781
What?

910
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:30,787
I'll get the money.

911
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:46,909
Great! Power outtage.

912
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:56,120
We've been eating and sleeping
here around the clock,

913
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:58,574
and chief had to pick today to bring us in?

914
00:52:58,667 --> 00:53:02,706
You think the chief could be
in on this with mubae?

915
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:06,493
Crazy fool...

916
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:10,872
Stop that.

917
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:13,539
You're ruining the sauce.

918
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,035
Who cares if it's ruined?

919
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:18,034
What's the point if mubae is gone?!

920
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,333
Strike.

921
00:53:25,792 --> 00:53:27,123
Did I tell you

922
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,619
this squad's gonna be disbanded?

923
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:32,449
That's why chief called us.

924
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:36,405
Nevertheless, we're family.

925
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,282
No...

926
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:42,115
Were family.

927
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,456
So let's laugh about it!

928
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:47,081
It can't get any worse than this!

929
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:50,120
It's a farewell party!

930
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:53,167
Hey...

931
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:57,535
- Captain!
- Captain!

932
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,707
Let's drug them with roofies.

933
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:16,077
You dumb sons of a...
oh no... Catch him.

934
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:17,623
Just a sec.

935
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:26,660
Captain...

936
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:42,581
I'm sorry, sir.

937
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:45,283
We worried things might go wrong.

938
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:47,949
We knew about the disbanding,

939
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:49,990
and we got anxious.

940
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:52,369
I'm the one to blame.

941
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,574
I got a taste of money.

942
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:01,415
I was sick and tired of stakeouts,

943
00:55:02,458 --> 00:55:08,283
but sometimes, I stayed out
longer to avoid going home,

944
00:55:08,917 --> 00:55:10,999
to avoid my wife's nagging.

945
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:15,699
But after becoming the owner
of a successful restaurant,

946
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:19,824
she started showering at night.

947
00:55:22,292 --> 00:55:24,499
That freaked me out a little.

948
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:29,913
Still, it made going home a joy.

949
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:32,000
Sir... Captain...

950
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,288
Cut it out. I feel like I'm really dying.

951
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:44,074
You sure it was just roofies?

952
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,616
Why does my neck feel stiff?

953
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:55,787
At least we have the chicken place.

954
00:55:58,583 --> 00:56:02,872
Let's continue tasting money

955
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:06,948
because this restaurant

956
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:09,407
is doing so well.

957
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:12,994
No secrets to emperor's chicken

958
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:15,165
after gaining popularity on social media,

959
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,332
this restaurant put a
preposterous price tag

960
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,749
on their so-called "emperor's chicken"

961
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:22,040
without any changes to their recipe.

962
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:25,498
But in reality, there was a change.

963
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,489
Shocking secret to success.
Package switching

964
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,957
they ordered from another restaurant

965
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:31,036
and switched the packaging.

966
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:35,116
I'm standing in front of the restaurant

967
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:36,775
and in the center of controversy...

968
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:40,166
Suwon xx marinade chicken in changchunag.

969
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:46,159
Captain... Shut your mouth.

970
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,822
You got the entire squad suspended.

971
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:55,124
You never cease to amaze me.

972
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,538
If you've been frying chicken all this
time, it means mubae has resurfaced.

973
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:00,783
Why didn't you report that to me?

974
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:02,205
To you?

975
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:06,035
I tipped you off for a joint investigation,
but you only thought of yourself

976
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:08,207
and screwed up the entire operation.

977
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:11,666
Why did you come to me
before reporting to the chief?

978
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:13,559
Catching mubae calls for
a multi-divisional task force,

979
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:15,539
but you didn't want to
share with anyone else.

980
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:20,851
Made us your surveillance cam.

981
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:23,241
The narc squad is still here because of me.

982
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:25,949
You should be thanking me!

983
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,533
Oh, yes! Definitely!

984
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,082
I said I was tired of you being captain,

985
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:49,240
so you became a cook instead?

986
00:57:49,917 --> 00:57:51,782
Ma is the cook.

987
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:56,704
I stayed with you because
you're a good man,

988
00:57:57,042 --> 00:58:00,489
but you ran a fake business
during work hours.

989
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:02,869
Who told you to bring
home that kind of money?

990
00:58:06,042 --> 00:58:09,455
Maybe it's for the best.

991
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,241
Quit the force once and for all.

992
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:24,323
You ruined your health on overtime,
stakeouts, and fights.

993
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,454
We get threats from crooks
you put behind bars.

994
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:31,706
People call you zombie as
if getting stabbed is a funny thing.

995
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:45,951
Not a day goes by
I don't worry you'll get hurt.

996
00:58:47,292 --> 00:58:50,912
Honey... Let's start fresh.

997
00:58:51,667 --> 00:58:54,579
I believe in you. You can do anything.

998
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:56,535
Thank you.

999
00:58:57,792 --> 00:59:00,784
We have no savings set aside,

1000
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:06,827
but there's your retirement fund.

1001
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:14,040
Let's open a small shop with that.

1002
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:19,323
I'm happy with anything but chicken.

1003
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:23,160
Oh, sweetie...

1004
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:26,415
Don't cry over something like this.

1005
00:59:26,667 --> 00:59:28,453
Stop!

1006
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:31,161
It's okay. Really.

1007
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:33,244
There, there.

1008
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,740
Big boys don't cry.

1009
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:37,664
Come on. It's okay.

1010
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,913
No... It's okay.

1011
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,910
You don't understand...

1012
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,101
- Shhh, it's okay.
- It's not.

1013
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:42,864
No, really.

1014
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:44,243
No, you don't understand.

1015
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:45,823
We can start over.

1016
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:49,790
It's okay. Shhh...

1017
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:53,374
Everything will be fine.

1018
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,160
Why are you here?

1019
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:02,414
Why are you?

1020
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:06,075
My wife will divorce me
if I don't get my retirement fund back.

1021
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:07,868
What else can I do?

1022
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:10,415
You're not going back to work?

1023
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:13,829
Even if I do, I'll be sent to a desk.

1024
01:00:14,583 --> 01:00:16,494
I'm suspended, but really,
they want me to quit.

1025
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:17,789
Come on, captain.

1026
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:20,662
Think about what you've
done to catch mubae.

1027
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,286
All the chicken you served...

1028
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,412
Work here until your suspension's lifted.

1029
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,740
We'll divide the earnings equally.

1030
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,643
Forget it. Why would we
run a chicken restaurant?

1031
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,703
He's right. We're detectives.

1032
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:33,990
Police officers!

1033
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:35,197
Welcome!

1034
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:36,455
Hi.

1035
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:42,033
I'd like to speak to the owner.

1036
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:49,708
Salt.

1037
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:50,617
What's this place?

1038
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:52,414
After gaining popularity on social media,

1039
01:00:52,417 --> 01:00:53,156
wow.

1040
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,615
This restaurant put a
preposterous price tag

1041
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:55,705
idiots.

1042
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:59,410
- On their so-called "emperor's chicken"
- That street looks familiar.

1043
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:00,288
I know them.

1044
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:02,661
- Without any changes fo their recipe.
- What a trash'

1045
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,197
we moved out because it
was getting crowded.

1046
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:10,410
Never play foul with food.

1047
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,662
We provide a genuine product
at honest quantities.

1048
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:15,956
Sir.

1049
01:01:17,417 --> 01:01:19,203
Why don't we contact them?

1050
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:20,702
What?

1051
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:23,618
Did you say you wanted?

1052
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:27,823
I want to open a nationwide franchise.

1053
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:33,536
Obviously, you missed the show.

1054
01:01:33,667 --> 01:01:36,283
Actually, I saw it and came straight here.

1055
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:40,409
A solid restaurant won't go down
after one instance of bad media.

1056
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,242
The public has a short memory.

1057
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,745
You can't go around defrauding people.

1058
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,037
You shouldn't do that
anyway, especially here.

1059
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:52,036
You'll thank me later. You can go.

1060
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,285
Yes.

1061
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:59,120
You'll look back and thank us all one day.

1062
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:04,073
You're so naive.

1063
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,242
Those who don't know investing

1064
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:11,158
think like you,
but for people like me,

1065
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:14,287
we love seeing competitive
products at rock bottom.

1066
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:18,869
People like us can't stand those
who try to profit

1067
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:20,494
off another's misfortune.

1068
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:21,705
Excuse me.

1069
01:02:26,417 --> 01:02:27,497
Here.

1070
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:30,035
Run a check on me.

1071
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:32,036
As you please.

1072
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,493
With all due respect,

1073
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:37,246
I don't think I can get
much by defrauding you.

1074
01:02:39,792 --> 01:02:41,373
That's true.

1075
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:43,869
I'm not asking for your business license.

1076
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,161
I want your brand name, recipe,

1077
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:48,957
and management knowhow. That's all.

1078
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:50,578
I'm bong-pal ma, the cook.

1079
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:51,873
Nice to meet you.

1080
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:54,744
Can you get him some tea?

1081
01:02:55,042 --> 01:02:56,248
Sure.

1082
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:01,410
Cap...

1083
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:03,125
Bro.

1084
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:12,290
My daughter, ye-Jin...

1085
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,287
Do you know what her dream
was when she was little?

1086
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:19,914
To be a suspect.

1087
01:03:21,542 --> 01:03:24,124
That way she'd see me more.

1088
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:27,741
My wife is a devoted Christian,

1089
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:31,910
yet she sewed a talisman into
my underwear for protection.

1090
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:44,493
This is my resignation.

1091
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:45,447
Captain!

1092
01:03:45,542 --> 01:03:49,364
I wanted to leave honorably,
but I guess it's come to this.

1093
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:56,703
How will you convince him?

1094
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,539
For the sake of justice?

1095
01:03:59,542 --> 01:04:01,624
If you live by the law,
that's honorable enough.

1096
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:05,325
I'll help him out til business settles.

1097
01:04:05,417 --> 01:04:06,122
That's right.

1098
01:04:06,417 --> 01:04:08,829
A dad you can see when you order chicken

1099
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:11,745
is better than a dad you can
only meet as a suspect

1100
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:16,448
well, I got to start saving again so...

1101
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:17,868
Okay...

1102
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:20,540
Let's look into this jung character first.

1103
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:23,666
People who walk around with
a bundle of cash are suspicious.

1104
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:27,197
Yes.

1105
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:28,448
He checks out.

1106
01:05:28,542 --> 01:05:29,577
No criminal record?

1107
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:30,372
Should there be?

1108
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:31,573
Yes!

1109
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:34,499
Sorry... what about his company?

1110
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:37,905
Even cleaner. Employs
various social groups,

1111
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,161
was commended for being
a social enterprise.

1112
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:43,166
Why am I telling you this?
Aren't you a cop?

1113
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:56,666
'Re-open. We are sorry'

1114
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,018
The flagship store must do well

1115
01:06:37,042 --> 01:06:39,158
for a franchise to flourish!

1116
01:06:42,792 --> 01:06:44,032
Does your leg still hurt?

1117
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,619
No, now my armpits do.

1118
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:50,074
That's what happens when you get older.

1119
01:06:50,167 --> 01:06:51,167
Yeah...

1120
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:53,869
How's work going?

1121
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:57,655
Jung has a good hold on things.

1122
01:06:57,917 --> 01:07:02,741
Our only concern is Ted Chang might attack.

1123
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:05,199
That's why I'll hit him first.

1124
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,208
Now?

1125
01:07:08,417 --> 01:07:09,457
Shall I round up the boys?

1126
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,364
No need.

1127
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:12,744
Let's go, sun-hee.

1128
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:18,034
Just the two of you?

1129
01:07:20,042 --> 01:07:21,042
That's suicidal.

1130
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,365
Hey, Chang-sik!

1131
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:54,575
You're all sunny and bubbly.

1132
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:57,698
If you come to me like this,

1133
01:07:57,792 --> 01:08:01,660
it renders my efforts to find you futile.

1134
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:04,290
I wasn't hiding that hard.

1135
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:05,990
I got bored, so I came.

1136
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,119
No, no. Back off.

1137
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:12,780
He fights like a girl.
It's just the two of you?

1138
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:13,955
With a girl?

1139
01:08:14,042 --> 01:08:15,998
Is there a wedding invitation?

1140
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:19,455
How's business? What's good here?

1141
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:22,864
It's a pizza place. Don't get the noodles.

1142
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:25,992
Wanna see our hew menu?

1143
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:28,485
Don't worry about paying since
you're not walking out alive.

1144
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:30,783
Pity. I'm taking herbal medicine.
Can't eat flour.

1145
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:32,414
I'll get to the point.

1146
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,706
Let's work together.

1147
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,750
Suwon rib marinade
chicken chicken?

1148
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:40,624
A pizza-kingdom-chicken-Princess
kinda place?

1149
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:45,614
This has been my mantra.

1150
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:48,242
School teachers,
students, workers,

1151
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:49,972
civil servants, priests,
and monks alike...

1152
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:53,322
I dream of a world where everyone
can buy drugs like cigarettes.

1153
01:08:53,417 --> 01:08:54,998
An era of meth for all.

1154
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:59,952
I perfected it, and I'm giving it to you.

1155
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:02,282
That's too long a last will.

1156
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:05,412
Lose all the hateful words, Chang-sik.

1157
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,831
My name's Ted Chang.

1158
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:07,622
Okay, Chang-sik.

1159
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:08,823
Ted Chang.

1160
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:15,413
Why are you Ted Chang
when your last name isn't Chang?

1161
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:20,078
You don't know how to make up
an english name, do you?

1162
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:22,448
Look...

1163
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:27,865
You can have all of Korea,

1164
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,412
and I'll supply you from China.

1165
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,037
You win here. I win there.

1166
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:39,825
So should I let you stab
me in the back again?

1167
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,323
Business is good?

1168
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:47,034
Come and have a look. It's on fire.

1169
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:51,323
Excuse me.

1170
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:54,741
I ordered like 30 minutes ago.

1171
01:09:55,708 --> 01:10:00,077
What happened to table 5's order?

1172
01:10:00,292 --> 01:10:03,284
Can't you see I'm eating?

1173
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:06,242
Stop pigging out, and
bring the damn chicken!

1174
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:10,326
I'm frying chicken all day.
I didn't sign up for this shit.

1175
01:10:10,417 --> 01:10:12,749
You think I wanted to be a bus boy?

1176
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:14,393
I'll shove your face in that fryer!

1177
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:16,578
Good! Your sister will love it when I...

1178
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:19,158
- You prick!
- Bring it!

1179
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:21,828
Did you just hit me, asshole?

1180
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:22,827
I'll make sashimi out of you!

1181
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:23,917
I'm gonna kill you!

1182
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:32,077
We're a group of 20!

1183
01:10:32,167 --> 01:10:33,167
We don't serve groups.

1184
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:36,073
I said we don't do groups.

1185
01:10:36,167 --> 01:10:41,491
Then we'll sit in 4's and
pretend to be strangers.

1186
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:42,743
You're hilarious!

1187
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:46,030
Come on, take a seat. We're not a group.

1188
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:49,083
Don't talk to other tables.

1189
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:50,708
This tastes funny.

1190
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:52,873
I thought the chicken here was dope.

1191
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:58,082
What did you say? Dope?

1192
01:10:58,167 --> 01:10:59,703
Are you saying we're selling dope?

1193
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:01,160
That's not what I meant.

1194
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,832
They're calling our chicken dope.

1195
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,581
What the hell?

1196
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,957
Who said that?

1197
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:14,032
Hey!

1198
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:17,351
They crushed us on TV, and
now they're pounding us online.

1199
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:19,331
We'll be finished for good.

1200
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,911
This guy's smoking in the kitchen.

1201
01:11:23,042 --> 01:11:25,408
And I thought things were going smoothly.

1202
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:28,454
People management is the
hardest part of this trade.

1203
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:33,998
Jung, that bastard... I'm sorry.

1204
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:37,246
You ruined our brand, and you're sorry?

1205
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:41,372
I'll be sure to hire better crews.

1206
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:43,414
Let me tell you this.

1207
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:46,870
If something like this happens again,

1208
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:50,371
forget the franchise.
I'm bringing you down with me.

1209
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:51,743
Point taken.

1210
01:11:58,958 --> 01:11:59,993
Want me to kill him?

1211
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,573
Not necessary.

1212
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:03,206
Maim?

1213
01:12:03,292 --> 01:12:07,706
No. Mubae secured a distributor.
Keep a low profile til he leaves.

1214
01:12:07,958 --> 01:12:11,200
We can't sit around. We'll
visit the branches.

1215
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:14,242
Man-gi chun. 35. Gwangju branch.

1216
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:18,030
26 days smoke-free,
3 days added to life expectancy.

1217
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:22,114
Cook. Hyo-bong jun. He
chops a size 11 chicken

1218
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:25,166
into 17 pieces with skilled knife work.

1219
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:26,330
Good. Next.

1220
01:12:26,417 --> 01:12:28,703
I surveilled the delivery guy
from 0930 to 2300.

1221
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:32,614
He did an average of 20
to 30 deliveries a day.

1222
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:36,038
Visitors dropped dramatically,
but delivery is still popular?

1223
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:38,411
He delivered 20 orders in one go,

1224
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,207
I'm worried the chicken might get soggy.

1225
01:12:41,292 --> 01:12:44,614
20 deliveries? Is he a newsboy?

1226
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:47,290
I saw something even more suspicious.

1227
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:51,197
A customer dumped the chicken
as soon as she got it.

1228
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:55,824
What the hell's going on?

1229
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:58,533
Deliveries need to be checked.

1230
01:12:58,625 --> 01:12:59,910
Young-ho,

1231
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:04,661
you and I will visit the victims...

1232
01:13:04,875 --> 01:13:06,661
I mean, customers.

1233
01:13:07,042 --> 01:13:08,077
Jae-hoon,

1234
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:09,831
you're promoted to cook.

1235
01:13:10,042 --> 01:13:10,576
Sir?

1236
01:13:10,667 --> 01:13:14,034
You've done enough as an assistant.
Can you handle it?

1237
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:17,998
I don't know what to say.

1238
01:13:18,667 --> 01:13:20,077
What about me?

1239
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:24,201
You'll be in charge of regional branches.

1240
01:13:24,292 --> 01:13:25,657
Monitor and educate the employees.

1241
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,741
You're putting me in charge?

1242
01:13:29,792 --> 01:13:30,827
- Jang?
- Sir.

1243
01:13:30,917 --> 01:13:33,624
You'll oversee this store
and the Metro branches.

1244
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:34,538
Yes, sir.

1245
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:36,581
That's all. Any questions?

1246
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:38,823
I... um...

1247
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:45,953
I'm a little confused. This isn't
a police operation, right?

1248
01:13:46,042 --> 01:13:48,408
This is for the business?

1249
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,286
Of course, honey.

1250
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:57,914
Chicken delivery!

1251
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:13,493
Excuse me.

1252
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:14,117
Yes?

1253
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:17,245
I'm looking for a man who ordered chicken.

1254
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:19,790
He's in there.

1255
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:27,239
The next stop?

1256
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:29,870
Billiard hall. Then...

1257
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,490
Exactly the same.

1258
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:38,119
The delivery route is identical.

1259
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:40,203
Does this ring a bell?

1260
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:45,414
Delivery.

1261
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:50,289
- I'll wire the money.
- Sorry?

1262
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:51,559
- I'll wire it.
- What're you talking about?

1263
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:53,289
Bank transfer... agh!

1264
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:04,907
Don't touch me!

1265
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,706
Look at me.

1266
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:12,990
Do it.

1267
01:15:29,667 --> 01:15:32,739
Good afternoon. We're from sk broadband...

1268
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:34,243
We use kt.

1269
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:40,374
And kt, here for a routine cable check.

1270
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:47,745
My cable works fine.

1271
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:51,865
Just checking to make sure.

1272
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:53,573
We won't be long.

1273
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:50,663
A bug.

1274
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,331
How did you get in here?

1275
01:16:55,417 --> 01:16:58,955
Your front door was locked,
so I used the back.

1276
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:04,787
Man, this is bad work ethics.
Dirtier than week-old frying oil.

1277
01:17:05,292 --> 01:17:07,499
It's still business hours.

1278
01:17:14,417 --> 01:17:20,117
He's okay for someone
from the head office.

1279
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:23,287
He's cool.

1280
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:26,700
Haven't seen an ugly face
like his in a while.

1281
01:17:26,792 --> 01:17:31,081
I heard the entire head office
will be cleaned out soon.

1282
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:32,493
Really?

1283
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:33,618
Didn't you know?

1284
01:17:33,708 --> 01:17:37,326
They'll hand over the company
to Ted Chang and kill jung.

1285
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:40,955
Makes sense. Better for the business.

1286
01:17:41,042 --> 01:17:43,283
Where'd you hear that?

1287
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:47,118
Chang's right hand
man is a friend of...

1288
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:49,369
You speak mandarin?

1289
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:52,657
- Yes.
- Why?

1290
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54,081
My family's from China.

1291
01:17:54,542 --> 01:17:57,614
Ahhh...

1292
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:23,164
Police lieutenant
bong-pal ma damn...

1293
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:25,539
This is no good.

1294
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:43,450
Wasn't this your idea?
Undercover or some sort?

1295
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:45,453
Not me! Never!

1296
01:18:45,542 --> 01:18:48,579
I knew this would happen,
so I got to steel crutch.

1297
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,081
Son of a bitch...

1298
01:18:53,417 --> 01:18:54,417
No! Please!

1299
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:55,663
Son of a bitch!

1300
01:18:56,542 --> 01:18:57,542
Hey!

1301
01:19:00,958 --> 01:19:02,789
Want me to bring in the rest?

1302
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:06,073
Do nothing til the rendezvous.

1303
01:19:06,417 --> 01:19:09,989
We'll lure the cops in and kill them there.

1304
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:12,660
Kill them?

1305
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:15,116
Yeah, and Ted Chang will take the fall.

1306
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:18,284
We'll pin it on him, take the money,
and ride away.

1307
01:19:19,625 --> 01:19:24,449
Keep your eyes on the cops til then.

1308
01:19:25,958 --> 01:19:27,038
Yes, boss.

1309
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:39,664
Are you insane?!

1310
01:19:40,583 --> 01:19:41,583
We should report this.

1311
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:45,364
Our franchise branches are runners.
What does that make us?

1312
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,661
Surely they won't think we're involved.

1313
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:48,614
We must catch them.

1314
01:19:48,708 --> 01:19:51,541
Look at their size. We're way outnumbered.

1315
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:54,249
Besides, we're suspended now.

1316
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:56,369
Who in this county
is capable of a deal this big?

1317
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,165
Ted Chang or mubae.

1318
01:19:59,292 --> 01:20:02,159
Police officers or chicken men
don't matter in catching a rat.

1319
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:05,663
Let's catch rats!

1320
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:07,947
Where is ma”?

1321
01:20:08,042 --> 01:20:10,203
Awol since last night.

1322
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:12,869
Think he's gambling again?

1323
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:16,746
Text him. We can't wait.

1324
01:20:19,958 --> 01:20:22,074
We'll go after jung first.

1325
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:37,206
He cleaned out.

1326
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:38,292
Dammit.

1327
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,369
Let's go to his house. I know the address.

1328
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,197
A video call now? He's got to be kidding.

1329
01:20:47,292 --> 01:20:48,292
Ma!

1330
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:51,456
- Mr. chicken...
- Detective ma!

1331
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:55,572
Get your ass over here now.
I don't think he'll last long.

1332
01:20:56,292 --> 01:21:00,456
I'll text you the location.

1333
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:05,198
Son of a bitch! What the hell's going on?

1334
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,491
Why are they stalling?

1335
01:21:11,917 --> 01:21:13,873
A husband tracker app?

1336
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:15,323
Come on. Let's go.

1337
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:16,827
Are you...?

1338
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:19,160
Come on.

1339
01:21:30,292 --> 01:21:31,873
We finish this today.

1340
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:33,994
It's gonna be a long night.

1341
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:35,160
Let's bury them.

1342
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:38,993
You might have to stay longer
in China this time.

1343
01:21:39,125 --> 01:21:42,697
Gotta get more money then.

1344
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:45,661
- Let's go to mom's house.
- Yes, boss.

1345
01:21:57,208 --> 01:22:00,700
Hong, you're such a momma's boy.

1346
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:03,581
Come back later. I'm busy.

1347
01:22:03,667 --> 01:22:05,203
You killed way too many this time.

1348
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:07,453
Momma's gonna be mad.

1349
01:22:07,542 --> 01:22:09,248
Jesus, man...

1350
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,490
You even brought a crew.

1351
01:22:12,625 --> 01:22:14,832
Organized crime vs organized crime. 4 on 4.

1352
01:22:15,167 --> 01:22:18,125
We've got no time. Kill them.

1353
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:19,208
Yes, boss.

1354
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:21,865
Cute.

1355
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:42,698
Let's go.

1356
01:23:11,667 --> 01:23:13,123
I'm going first.

1357
01:23:18,375 --> 01:23:19,990
I think he's trying to do something.

1358
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:24,448
Filthy ass-face.

1359
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,956
Well, well...

1360
01:23:28,958 --> 01:23:32,496
It won't go like you think.
This isn't a movie.

1361
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:38,456
What are you doing?

1362
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:45,366
They took him far.

1363
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,582
Step on it. Come on!

1364
01:23:47,792 --> 01:23:50,158
Don't worry. Ma isn't gonna die.

1365
01:23:50,583 --> 01:23:51,948
I'm not worried about that.

1366
01:23:52,083 --> 01:23:53,789
I'm worried he might kill them.

1367
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:00,992
People think I joined the force

1368
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:03,533
through a special admissions program.

1369
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:05,289
What do you think?

1370
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:49,956
No one believes it,

1371
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:53,825
but I was on the national judo team.

1372
01:24:56,083 --> 01:24:57,289
Not bad, right?

1373
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:17,163
You think we're on the same side
because we were tied up together?

1374
01:25:29,417 --> 01:25:31,744
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1375
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:34,993
His location changed.

1376
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:36,163
Let me see.

1377
01:25:36,875 --> 01:25:38,035
What the...

1378
01:25:41,042 --> 01:25:42,248
He's close by.

1379
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,786
It changed again.

1380
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:48,040
Well, goddammit!

1381
01:26:06,042 --> 01:26:07,748
Oh, my arms... my arms...

1382
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:15,493
MISSED CALL: 132

1383
01:26:19,125 --> 01:26:20,205
shit.

1384
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,661
I got a text from ma.

1385
01:26:24,792 --> 01:26:26,953
What does it say?

1386
01:26:27,083 --> 01:26:28,118
Where the hell are you?

1387
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:30,240
Mb Main... building?

1388
01:26:32,167 --> 01:26:33,577
Military base?

1389
01:26:57,667 --> 01:26:59,999
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1390
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:10,824
You brought a whole regiment.

1391
01:27:10,917 --> 01:27:13,124
I have zero trust in you.

1392
01:27:13,583 --> 01:27:17,121
If you call the cops again, I'll kill you.

1393
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:20,951
Oh, you're scaring me.
You carrying a blade?

1394
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:22,282
Bet your ass I am.

1395
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:23,706
Good because we got guns.

1396
01:27:23,792 --> 01:27:24,907
We do too.

1397
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,331
Show me.

1398
01:27:26,417 --> 01:27:28,954
I'm not showing you shit.

1399
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:40,289
Just gimme my money. I've
got to boat to catch.

1400
01:27:40,708 --> 01:27:41,868
The goods first.

1401
01:27:45,542 --> 01:27:48,284
This is huge.

1402
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,331
Shit! Text me. Text me!

1403
01:27:56,417 --> 01:27:57,372
Can't hear you. Where are you?

1404
01:27:57,375 --> 01:27:58,559
They're all here. Mubae. Ted Chang.

1405
01:27:58,583 --> 01:27:59,538
Speak up!

1406
01:27:59,542 --> 01:28:00,452
Text me.

1407
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:03,158
Shut up. Wait there. We're coming.

1408
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:10,788
What do I do? Think!

1409
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:12,740
911, 911...

1410
01:28:21,542 --> 01:28:23,578
You gonna go through every single bag?

1411
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:26,415
You're spilling half of it.

1412
01:28:26,833 --> 01:28:28,539
All grade a, boss.

1413
01:28:28,792 --> 01:28:30,077
You're not taking too much?

1414
01:28:30,167 --> 01:28:31,782
I'm okay. I ate a big lunch.

1415
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:32,614
- You good?
- Yes, sir.

1416
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:34,143
Let's have some trust between friends.

1417
01:28:34,167 --> 01:28:35,407
Bring over the money.

1418
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:41,199
- Test more.
- Yes, sir.

1419
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:46,039
You backstabbing mother...

1420
01:28:46,125 --> 01:28:48,366
That's an ambulance, you moron!

1421
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,912
Your tiny eyes almost popped out.

1422
01:28:51,042 --> 01:28:52,998
I knew it was an ambulance.

1423
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:11,494
Must be a fire nearby.

1424
01:29:19,375 --> 01:29:20,535
Drop your weapons!

1425
01:29:21,833 --> 01:29:23,573
Why did you shoot me?!

1426
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:36,325
I'm such a genius.

1427
01:29:36,542 --> 01:29:37,542
Go on. Kill each other.

1428
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:39,448
Do it. Do it. Do it.

1429
01:29:44,417 --> 01:29:45,417
I won't let you.

1430
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:47,164
No, you don't.

1431
01:30:01,042 --> 01:30:02,327
You're not going anywhere.

1432
01:30:02,458 --> 01:30:04,949
- I won't let you.
- Let me go!

1433
01:30:50,083 --> 01:30:51,493
Suwon rib marinade chicken

1434
01:30:52,333 --> 01:30:55,325
this just isn't my scene...

1435
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:57,948
You can't get away.

1436
01:31:00,625 --> 01:31:01,785
Get the money.

1437
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:12,324
- Aren't you embarrassed?
- Man...

1438
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:22,206
Did you request backup?

1439
01:31:22,292 --> 01:31:23,393
They have no one to dispatch.

1440
01:31:23,417 --> 01:31:27,035
It's mubae and Ted Chang.
We got to get there.

1441
01:31:27,125 --> 01:31:28,125
Yes, sir.

1442
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:40,323
Can I fight now, captain?

1443
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:42,494
Like a real cop!

1444
01:31:42,667 --> 01:31:43,702
Wait.

1445
01:31:43,792 --> 01:31:45,328
Okay!

1446
01:31:46,917 --> 01:31:48,157
You're from the head store.

1447
01:31:48,333 --> 01:31:51,655
You got to present for us.

1448
01:31:51,958 --> 01:31:55,030
Take him and leave. I'll let you live.

1449
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:57,912
Looks like more than 30 bucks,
so I can't take it.

1450
01:31:58,583 --> 01:31:59,823
Come with me.

1451
01:31:59,917 --> 01:32:02,329
Cops these days have no fear.

1452
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:06,495
Are you... just four?

1453
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:08,949
We're five, dumb-ass!

1454
01:32:12,583 --> 01:32:14,665
Back down. You're injured.

1455
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:18,405
I'll just get one of them.

1456
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:20,618
These morons...

1457
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:22,243
Kill them!

1458
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:31,449
Narcs will get killed.

1459
01:32:31,792 --> 01:32:33,453
It's manageable.

1460
01:32:33,917 --> 01:32:34,497
Sorry?

1461
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,741
You can talk sense with thugs,

1462
01:32:36,917 --> 01:32:40,785
but dope heads are just plain crazy.

1463
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,956
Why do you think the
chief put them together?

1464
01:32:43,042 --> 01:32:45,704
Ma is an ex-judo national athlete.

1465
01:33:12,667 --> 01:33:15,704
What do you want from me?

1466
01:33:15,917 --> 01:33:18,158
You said I'm uglier than you.

1467
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,491
Do you know hurtful that is?

1468
01:33:34,708 --> 01:33:38,280
Young-ho is ex-udt.

1469
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:47,831
I've heard rumors he's killed people.

1470
01:34:01,667 --> 01:34:04,989
Jang is a muay thai Asian champion.

1471
01:34:10,917 --> 01:34:14,703
She was nicknamed jang
bak' after ong bak.

1472
01:34:16,667 --> 01:34:17,827
What about that newbie?

1473
01:34:19,708 --> 01:34:20,809
High school baseball league.

1474
01:34:20,833 --> 01:34:21,833
Baseball?

1475
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,288
In this country, if you play ball,

1476
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:27,073
you grow resilient to blows.

1477
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:32,164
It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt.

1478
01:34:33,375 --> 01:34:34,581
It doesn't hurt one bit.

1479
01:34:46,583 --> 01:34:49,290
What about captain ko?

1480
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:53,244
They don't call him 'zombie' for nothing.

1481
01:34:53,333 --> 01:34:55,413
In the 20 years he's been
with major crimes division,

1482
01:34:55,583 --> 01:34:59,405
he's sustained 12 stab
wounds and still lived.

1483
01:34:59,917 --> 01:35:02,408
He just doesn't die.

1484
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:00,413
Mubae!

1485
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,161
Argh... this guy!

1486
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:41,118
Jae-hoon?

1487
01:36:41,458 --> 01:36:42,618
Jae-hoon!

1488
01:36:42,792 --> 01:36:43,827
Dammit...

1489
01:37:00,875 --> 01:37:03,491
I don't go easy on women.

1490
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:07,330
My eye!

1491
01:37:11,875 --> 01:37:12,875
I won't die! I won't die!

1492
01:37:12,958 --> 01:37:13,958
I will not diel!

1493
01:37:37,083 --> 01:37:38,493
That son of a bitch...

1494
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:40,535
Hey!

1495
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,824
You bruised up his face,
and that's all he's got!

1496
01:38:29,917 --> 01:38:30,952
Stop! You'll kill her!

1497
01:38:31,917 --> 01:38:33,077
Enough!

1498
01:38:34,292 --> 01:38:35,372
Fine...

1499
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:37,865
Jae-hoon...

1500
01:38:40,375 --> 01:38:43,287
Don't fuss.

1501
01:38:44,458 --> 01:38:47,905
Tying them up is harder than
busting their asses.

1502
01:38:50,417 --> 01:38:51,748
Care to help?

1503
01:38:53,167 --> 01:38:54,532
Yes, sir.

1504
01:38:56,833 --> 01:38:58,539
I'll finish him then get to you.

1505
01:38:58,625 --> 01:38:59,910
Okay.

1506
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:02,073
Actually, let's tie your legs first.

1507
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:04,158
- Yes, let's do that.
- Gimme your legs.

1508
01:39:04,792 --> 01:39:05,792
This is good.

1509
01:39:05,833 --> 01:39:06,697
Thank you, sir.

1510
01:39:06,792 --> 01:39:08,783
- We can do this, right?
- Of course.

1511
01:39:21,583 --> 01:39:22,868
Oh, good Christ!

1512
01:39:23,167 --> 01:39:25,749
I'm not gonna die. I'm not gonna die.

1513
01:39:26,167 --> 01:39:28,032
Come here, you piece of shit.

1514
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:31,580
That...

1515
01:39:34,042 --> 01:39:35,248
Son of a bitch.

1516
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:37,035
Son of a bitch.

1517
01:40:19,917 --> 01:40:20,952
Blood!

1518
01:40:31,375 --> 01:40:33,206
I don't have a gun, idiot.

1519
01:40:34,583 --> 01:40:36,448
I'm not a police officer now.

1520
01:40:37,167 --> 01:40:40,284
Then what are you?

1521
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:43,662
Me? I'm a chicken man.

1522
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:49,789
That's what you went with?

1523
01:40:50,042 --> 01:40:52,408
Who you are doesn't matter
when catching a rat.

1524
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:56,661
I'll let you go. Just stop.

1525
01:40:57,333 --> 01:40:58,743
You can swim, right?

1526
01:40:59,083 --> 01:40:59,913
Just jump over.

1527
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,331
I can't swim.

1528
01:41:01,417 --> 01:41:03,328
Why stick out your neck for nothing?

1529
01:41:03,417 --> 01:41:05,533
Because you did wrong.

1530
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:08,832
Here's what you don't get
about small business owners.

1531
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:12,322
We stick our necks out for what we do.

1532
01:41:16,083 --> 01:41:17,163
So fuck off!

1533
01:41:24,542 --> 01:41:25,657
You bastard!

1534
01:41:39,958 --> 01:41:41,698
Holy shit...

1535
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,161
Call an ambulance.

1536
01:44:28,583 --> 01:44:30,289
This time it was a gun.

1537
01:44:33,958 --> 01:44:35,949
I cannot believe this.

1538
01:44:36,042 --> 01:44:39,910
My first arrest and I
don't remember anything.

1539
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:43,081
He took a bullet for you.

1540
01:44:45,083 --> 01:44:47,620
You're my father from today on!

1541
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:51,615
Don't...

1542
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:53,660
Did you say something, father?

1543
01:44:54,875 --> 01:44:55,955
Come again?

1544
01:44:57,542 --> 01:45:00,659
That hurts, you idiot.

1545
01:45:05,375 --> 01:45:06,581
Did you mean that?

1546
01:45:06,708 --> 01:45:07,708
What?

1547
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,956
That good looks is all I've got?

1548
01:45:10,417 --> 01:45:12,624
What else is there?

1549
01:45:13,083 --> 01:45:15,745
And you installed a husband tracker?

1550
01:45:16,125 --> 01:45:18,992
Because you keep getting in trouble.

1551
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:33,530
Aw aw aw, that hurts.

1552
01:45:37,708 --> 01:45:38,538
Sir!

1553
01:45:38,625 --> 01:45:39,956
- Can I borrow your gun?
- Sir?

1554
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:42,579
I got to shoot someone. Is it loaded?

1555
01:45:42,667 --> 01:45:45,124
I got to shoot them.

1556
01:45:46,125 --> 01:45:48,787
What did you say, dad?

1557
01:45:48,917 --> 01:45:51,158
It's not loaded, sir.

1558
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:54,947
Stop them. Stop both of them.

1559
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:57,948
Please...

1560
01:46:34,583 --> 01:46:37,290
It was a shuttle bus that caught Hong?

1561
01:46:38,792 --> 01:46:40,578
It was a school bus!

1562
01:46:50,292 --> 01:46:53,250
And now the appointment ceremony.

1563
01:46:53,625 --> 01:46:56,583
Sergeant bong-pal ma, narcotics squad,

01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:58,615
is hereby appointed lieutenant.

1565
01:46:58,708 --> 01:47:05,113
The chief of Seoul district police
department, sang-il baek.

1566
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:12,457
Have you seen an entire squad
get a special promotion?

1567
01:47:12,542 --> 01:47:14,828
Guess who put together that team?

1568
01:47:19,583 --> 01:47:22,905
Arms down. Turn around.

1569
01:47:24,417 --> 01:47:26,328
Attention. Salute!

1570
01:47:28,917 --> 01:47:30,282
