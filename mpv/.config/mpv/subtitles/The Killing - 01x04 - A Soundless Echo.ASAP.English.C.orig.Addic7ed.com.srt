00:00:01,031 --> 00:00:03,918
Previously on AMC's
The Killing...

2
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:06,903
Rosie Larsens' body was
found in the trunk of

3
00:00:06,993 --> 00:00:08,496
a car stolen
from this campaign.

4
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:10,507
By now most of you have
heard what happened to Rosie.

5
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:12,533
Grief counselors will be...
Sterling!

6
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:14,382
I did find this from
a few days ago.

7
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:16,191
Leaking Yitanes' endorsement.

8
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:19,017
Don't I even get a chance
to defend myself here?

9
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,197
You just did.

10
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:21,575
Screw both of you.

11
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,358
He was in the
basement with Rosie?

12
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:26,591
Rosie's teacher
confiscated a phone

13
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:28,288
from a student earlier today.

14
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:29,998
They did it together.

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,391
Let me out of here, you bitch!

16
00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:45,892
<i>Let me out!</i>

17
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:48,595
<i>Let...Me...Out!</i>

18
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:08,013
You can't keep me in here.
I know my rights.

19
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:13,419
I didn't do anything to her!

20
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:28,635
What do you want, huh?
What?

21
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:36,109
I didn't kill her, I swear.

22
00:01:38,413 --> 00:01:40,280
So, Rosie, senior year.

23
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:43,216
<i>Where you gonna be
10 years from now?</i>

24
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,921
<i>Uh...Well, I mean,
who knows what's gonna happen?</i>

25
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:51,023
<i>Uh, today is all that matters,</i>

26
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:55,527
<i>and, uh, I want...
I don't know...</i>

27
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:59,797
<i>um...I want to
see everything,</i>

28
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:01,065
<i>see the world.</i>

29
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,400
<i>Uh...</i>

30
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:06,271
<i>I am just so ready
to start living, I guess.</i>

31
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:12,310
<i>Was that okay?</i>

32
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,585
<i>Tell her that.</i>

33
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:23,557
What?

34
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:27,461
Tell her you didn't kill her.

35
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:30,731
Look at her.

36
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:37,438
<i>Tell her.</i>

38
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:26,086
This kid's been here all night.

39
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,589
He's jonesing...
Ready to break.

40
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:31,259
You think?

41
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:33,795
Ames is in the waiting room
with his lawyer.

42
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,030
You're not gonna get much.

43
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:36,565
It helps put
the pressure on kris

44
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,534
knowing his friend
might want to cut a deal.

45
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:39,635
You talking to him?

46
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:42,104
Yeah. Holder will take
the tweaker.

47
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,072
Is it okay
if I use your office?

48
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,570
Ah. That junkie in there
looks better than you do.

49
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,373
Why don't you clean yourself up
and put on a suit?

50
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:16,686
Hey, your date's with me.

51
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,457
We thought you'd be more
comfortable with your father here,

52
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:22,597
but it seems he wasn't
able to make it.

53
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:25,268
Mr. ames is currently
out of the country.

54
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:27,706
This is just a courtesy visit
on our end.

55
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,642
You can direct any questions
you have to me.

56
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:33,986
A video has come
into our possession

57
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,323
taken the night
of Rosie Larsen's murder.

58
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:38,795
She's in it.
So's your client.

59
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:40,834
What video?

60
00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:42,870
Mr. ames, please.

61
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:46,777
Would you like to see it?

62
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,323
As you can see, we have a wide
selection to choose from.

63
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:58,362
This lovely two-toned
brushed-steel model

64
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:02,001
boasts a white velvet interior
in a French fold design,

65
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:06,708
eternal rest adjustable bed,
and matching pillow and throw.

66
00:05:06,742 --> 00:05:11,013
And all our caskets fit the
standard 30-inch burial vaults.

67
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:13,215
Burial vaults?

68
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:15,284
Protection for your loved one

69
00:05:15,318 --> 00:05:17,919
against the outside
weather elements...

70
00:05:17,954 --> 00:05:20,455
rain and so forth.

71
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:27,328
The list price for these
models begins at $2,000.

72
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:31,532
Of course,
there's always cremation...

73
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:33,234
considerably less expensive...

74
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:34,569
no.

75
00:05:34,604 --> 00:05:36,806
I understand.

76
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,676
Then you'll want to consider
a flower spray for the casket

77
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,114
or perhaps wreaths
for the church.

78
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:52,191
That's a beautiful choice
for a young girl.

79
00:05:58,534 --> 00:06:03,539
The list price is $3,800.

80
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:05,475
We have reasonable
payment plans,

81
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:07,010
if that's your concern.

82
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:10,314
No, we're set.

83
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:12,816
Then I'll just need a nice dress
for your daughter.

84
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,819
You would like her
in a nice dress, wouldn't you?

85
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:24,030
I wish I had good news,
but I don't.

86
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:26,065
You're dropping fast
across the board,

87
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,768
losing traction with your
key constituencies, even.

88
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:30,704
Mayor's now got
an 8-point lead,

89
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:32,939
so, frankly, you're screwed.

90
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:35,509
The Yitanes endorsement
didn't stop the hemorrhaging?

91
00:06:35,543 --> 00:06:37,078
No, Adams is choking
the airwaves,

92
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:38,613
hammering you
with that dead girl.

93
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:40,582
But the car was stolen.
We had nothing to do with it.

94
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,718
Well, clearly, that message
isn't getting through.

95
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:45,854
What you need is a media
blitz... ads, billboards.

96
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,657
Yeah, we need to remind voters
that you're the anti-crime guy

97
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:50,659
and that Adams never
gave a damn till now.

98
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:52,528
Better hurry before he grabs up
the airtime that's left.

99
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:54,663
Well, then let's do it
right now.

100
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:57,367
With what money?

101
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:01,638
Thank you, Michael.

102
00:07:07,646 --> 00:07:09,247
We need to go to Tom Drexler.

103
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:11,349
No.
He hates Adams.

104
00:07:11,383 --> 00:07:13,484
He hates politicians.

105
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,487
He thinks we're all hand puppets
for rich lunatics like him.

106
00:07:16,522 --> 00:07:18,856
I don't know.
Maybe we are.

107
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:20,925
Darren, he could be
a good friend to us.

108
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,093
How?

109
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:23,361
I'm not making a deal

110
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:25,864
with a guy whose patron Saint
is Ayn Rand.

111
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:28,166
You won't have to. All he
cares about is screwing Adams.

112
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,701
We help with that,
we're golden.

113
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:32,470
At least talk to him.

114
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:34,773
We need someone with
that kind of money right now.

115
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:37,576
One thing Jamie was right about
was using him.

116
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:41,381
Get me my donors list.

117
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:44,417
I'll start making phone calls
after the committee meeting.

118
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:56,765
<i>Let me at that bitch.
Give her to me.</i>

119
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:02,805
It's not what you think.

120
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,141
Looks pretty clear to me.

121
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:07,978
We didn't do anything
to her, okay?

122
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:10,615
My client doesn't need to
answer any of your questions.

123
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:16,620
You don't seem like the type
that shares your toys.

124
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:19,357
And that's what Rosie was,
right? A toy?

125
00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:21,525
This is over.
Let's go, Mr. ames.

126
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,894
Wait, wait, I can explain.

127
00:08:22,928 --> 00:08:24,796
It's in your best interest
not to... just shut up!

128
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,165
It... it isn't
what you think.

129
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:35,238
Just turned 18.

130
00:08:35,273 --> 00:08:38,307
Ain't gonna be no comfy
juvie digs for you.

131
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:41,944
You're gonna be wearing
a micro mini mini

132
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:43,879
by the time you get out
of adult pen.

133
00:08:45,648 --> 00:08:47,615
Jasper gets the hot chick,
and I get you?

134
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,117
Yeah.

135
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:55,156
They know you got the itch
like me?

136
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:02,796
Damn.

137
00:09:02,831 --> 00:09:05,867
Boyfriend laid it on you.

138
00:09:08,837 --> 00:09:12,207
Jasper's crazy, okay?
He hated Rosie.

139
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:14,542
Yeah, you're just his wingman,
right? Along for the ride?

140
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:19,047
She always said hi.

141
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:21,684
Rosie didn't treat me
like I was...

142
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:23,919
A rock-bottom junkie?

143
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:26,655
What you gonna tell me next?

144
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:28,657
You used to walk home together
from school?

145
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:31,026
You got a minute? I'm in the
middle of something here, linden.

146
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,661
I know.
Let's go.

147
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:35,097
Yo, I'll check you later,
all right?

148
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:38,034
Fine.

149
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,343
Another movie?
I want popcorn.

150
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:49,712
Hey, you shut up, all right?!

151
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:06,360
<i>Yeah.</i>

152
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,102
<i>Let me at that bitch.
Give her to me.</i>

153
00:10:22,677 --> 00:10:24,578
<i>That's what you got?</i>

154
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:30,151
Man, you don't know shit.

155
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:42,363
Hey, mayor.
Jimmy.

156
00:10:42,397 --> 00:10:43,964
Say hello to your dad for me.

157
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,666
Yes, sir.

158
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:46,968
- Hey, Al.
- Hey.

159
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:48,670
Give me the usual.
You got it.

160
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,775
And get him another of whatever
the hell he's drinking.

161
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:56,711
Interesting choice
in venue, mayor.

162
00:10:56,745 --> 00:10:58,646
This place and me go way back.

163
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,215
Used to wait
for my old man outside.

164
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:03,417
Blackout drunk.

165
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:07,621
Me, 9 years old, dragging
his sorry a... back home.

166
00:11:07,655 --> 00:11:12,893
Spent a lot of hours
looking at that, wanting more.

167
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:16,197
I heard the story, mayor.

168
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:17,732
I just don't understand

169
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:20,301
why Seattle needs
another yuppie mall.

170
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:22,337
Not exactly a boon
for the everyman.

171
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:24,506
<i>Screw the everyman.
I'm the everyman.</i>

172
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,376
And that thing's gonna
bear my name, be my legacy.

173
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,847
Not bad for a poor kid
from highland park.

174
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:32,515
I hear you're
from pigeon point.

175
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:35,918
White trash...
Just like you.

176
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:38,053
<i>Waterfront
revitalization program.</i>

177
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:39,921
<i>A vote for Adams
is a vote for experience.</i>

178
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:41,255
<i>Lesley Adams,
a name you can trust.</i>

179
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,590
Look at that, hmm?

180
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:44,859
<i>This message paid for by...</i>

181
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:48,195
Can't say I was too surprised.

182
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:50,030
Your situation with Richmond.

183
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:52,632
Guy's an amateur,
not ready for the big leagues.

184
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,966
How do you figure?

185
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:57,337
Carpetbagging rich kid who
saved some souls a few years.

186
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:00,340
He doesn't know how to win
'cause he never had to.

187
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,979
I believed in that guy.

188
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:09,082
I guess it was
a one-way street.

189
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:11,784
Maybe you're right.

190
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:15,121
<i>I know I'm right.
That's why I asked you here.</i>

191
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:18,124
So, how about it?

192
00:12:18,158 --> 00:12:19,892
How about what?

193
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:23,196
<i>Come over and be part
of a winning team for once.</i>

194
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:31,004
Mrs. Danzinger,
you've been a generous donor,

195
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:34,374
and I really hope I can
rely on your support again.

196
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:35,843
I'm sorry, councilman.

197
00:12:35,877 --> 00:12:38,279
We're not going to be able
to help.

198
00:12:38,313 --> 00:12:40,948
No, I...

199
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:42,016
Not at this time.

200
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,985
I understand.
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:46,955
Of course.

202
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,224
Thank you for your time.

203
00:12:55,798 --> 00:12:57,232
Senator Eaton's office.

204
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:59,401
Hi. It's Gwen.

205
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:00,635
Hi, Gwen.

206
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:03,370
I need to see the senator.
Does he have an opening?

207
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:05,739
Let me check.

208
00:13:05,773 --> 00:13:08,342
You and Rosie
were best friends.

209
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:11,444
Yeah. I guess.

210
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:13,113
<i>You guess?</i>

211
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:14,948
I mean...We are.

212
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:18,319
Were.
Rosie's dead.

213
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:20,120
I know.

214
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:24,693
So, why'd you go down
to the cage with her boyfriend?

215
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:26,895
Did they force you?

216
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,431
No!

217
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,033
There was a lot of blood down there.
I get really bad nosebleeds.

218
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:32,736
I've gone to the hospital
for them.

219
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,937
But they didn't make me.

220
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:37,540
I mean, I was drunk,
and Jasper thought it'd be funny

221
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:39,476
if I put on her witch costume.

222
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,278
So what?

223
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:43,213
Rosie was okay with that?

224
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:47,551
She'd already left, didn't
tell me where she was going.

225
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:49,654
She never even said goodbye.

226
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:53,325
Mm.
You were mad at Rosie.

227
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:55,728
She changed so much, you know?

228
00:13:55,762 --> 00:13:57,964
After she broke up with Jasper.

229
00:13:57,998 --> 00:14:01,567
She'd never hang out,
disappear during fourth period,

230
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:03,903
tell her mom she was spending
the night, and she wasn't.

231
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:06,773
Where was she going?
I don't know.

232
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:09,209
I saw her get on the bus
a bunch of times.

233
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:10,577
Which bus?

234
00:14:10,612 --> 00:14:14,581
Outside of school...
the 108.

235
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:18,151
What do
you think she was doing?

236
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:22,288
I think she met someone...

237
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:24,290
Someone she couldn't
tell anyone about.

238
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:28,927
Not even her bff?

239
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:32,364
We wasted a lot time
'cause of you, Sterling.

240
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:34,599
Why'd you lie?

241
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:36,035
I-I don't know.

242
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:37,703
Why'd you go down there
with him?

243
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:40,806
'Cause he was nice to me, okay?

244
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,576
No one is nice to me.

245
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,178
I mean, not like they are
to Rosie.

246
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:48,715
I'm like...

247
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:52,853
Not even there
when she's around.

248
00:14:54,422 --> 00:14:57,491
I didn't mean to hurt her.
I didn't, but...

249
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:04,399
Don't you ever just
want to feel like...

250
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:06,668
You're here?

251
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:11,707
If Rosie was having an affair,
it might explain the shoes.

252
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:13,575
That key didn't fit
her school locker, right?

253
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,843
No.

254
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:17,145
M-maybe she had some
secret lockbox or something

255
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:19,714
where she stashed the guy's
love letters and stuff.

256
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:22,049
Where? We already
checked her bedroom.

257
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:24,285
I'll talk to the Larsens...

258
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:26,854
I'll do it. I'm meeting them
at the station.

259
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:28,556
'Course you are.

260
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,957
I-I love this partnership.

261
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:31,392
Y-you do
whatever you want,

262
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:33,261
and I spend my time
chasing you down.

263
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:35,463
Is there a problem?

264
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:41,136
Rosie was sneaking out
during school,

265
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,505
taking the bus,
maybe meeting someone.

266
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:45,073
Yeah? So?

267
00:15:45,108 --> 00:15:47,376
The 108 doesn't hit
her neighborhood from here,

268
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,443
from fort Washington.

269
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:51,079
Find out where she went.

270
00:15:55,197 --> 00:15:57,065
Sorry to hear
about the dead girl.

271
00:15:57,099 --> 00:16:00,802
We have it under control.

272
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,937
I've been at this a lot longer
than you have, Gwyneth.

273
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:07,208
Maybe it's time to admit
you bet on the wrong horse.

274
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:11,846
I appreciate the concern,
but I know what I'm doing.

275
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:16,251
Tom Drexler.

276
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:18,820
Can you get me a meeting?

277
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:22,557
<i>Well, it depends.
Is this you asking...Or Darren?</i>

278
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:25,126
He doesn't know I'm here.

279
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:28,396
Interesting.
Going behind his back.

280
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:31,433
Maybe you have a bit more
initiative than I thought.

281
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:35,536
I told you, dad.
I'm doing this my way.

282
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:37,239
Your way?

283
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:42,444
Is that what you call
sleeping with your candidate?

284
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:48,417
Yeah?

285
00:16:52,222 --> 00:16:54,591
The coroner can facilitate

286
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,593
the transfer
to the funeral home.

287
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:58,529
You'll just need to tell them
where to send her.

288
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:04,169
There's something that I need
you to look at before you go.

289
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:07,271
Um...Do you recognize
these items?

290
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:10,775
Are they Rosie's?

291
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:13,110
We think so, yes.

292
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:17,181
Did Rosie have
a lockbox at home?

293
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:21,219
I don't think so.

294
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:23,921
We think she may have been
seeing someone.

295
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:26,457
I told you,
she broke up with Jasper.

296
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:29,660
Not Jasper.
Possibly an adult.

297
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:33,663
No, my daughter's
not like that.

298
00:17:33,697 --> 00:17:34,897
Y-you don't know her.

299
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:37,033
Y-you don't... you don't know
anything about her.

300
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:41,603
Excuse me.

301
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:44,272
Hi, Regi.

302
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:47,109
Sure, I can pick up Jack.
He's at the boat?

303
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:30,684
Sorry about that.

304
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:39,826
I'm so sorry,
Mrs. Larsen, Mr. Larsen.

305
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,262
Are we done here?

306
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:45,665
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:00,483
This is
my one-on-one?

308
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:03,386
Well, let's make the best
of the opportunity we have.

309
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,454
That means smile, Darren.

310
00:19:09,258 --> 00:19:11,659
I'm not sure that'll happen.

311
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:14,829
At least you both
like basketball.

312
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,697
About 3:00 in the morning,
we come back,

313
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:20,400
and we find him in the hallway
completely naked...

314
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:23,203
Welcome to the snake pit.

315
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:25,038
I didn't think this was
your kind of scene, Darren.

316
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:26,940
I could say the same
about you, mayor.

317
00:19:26,974 --> 00:19:28,141
Oh, I just dropped by

318
00:19:28,175 --> 00:19:29,977
to toast the king of Seattle...

319
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:33,146
And stick my waterfront project
up his a... while I was at it.

320
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:35,816
Well, you do know how
to come bearing gifts.

321
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,951
It's nice you two are a pair.

322
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:39,386
In this racket,

323
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,489
it's a miracle to find someone
you can really trust, hmm?

324
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:46,193
Ladies and gentlemen!

325
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,761
Look who we have here.

326
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:50,398
It's our very own
mayoral candidates.

327
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:53,134
In this corner, mayor Adams.

328
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:55,270
Don't let that baboon smile
fool you.

329
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:57,572
No doubt,
he will steal your money

330
00:19:57,606 --> 00:19:59,707
and then stab you in the balls.

331
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:04,679
And here we have our challenger,
Darren Richmond...

332
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:08,049
bright-eyed, bushy-tailed,
"yes, we can!"

333
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:11,620
I got an idea.
Screw the election.

334
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:14,689
How about the two of you
finish it right here,

335
00:20:14,723 --> 00:20:16,257
mano a mano?

336
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,260
What say you?
Winner take all?

337
00:20:19,294 --> 00:20:21,362
Much as I'm sure the mayor

338
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:25,332
would love to show off
his full-court game...

339
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:27,934
I think I'll take my chances
with the voters.

340
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:33,339
Darren Richmond.

341
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:41,713
No, I'm telling you, linden,
this is stupid.

342
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:43,314
Did you ask if he had seen her?

343
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:45,550
No, the driver
couldn't I.D. Her.

344
00:20:45,584 --> 00:20:48,419
I need you to check again.

345
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:50,188
Yeah, whatever.

346
00:20:54,393 --> 00:20:57,061
Yo, chief, take one last look?

347
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:58,329
You seen this girl?

348
00:20:58,364 --> 00:21:00,031
No.

349
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:08,039
Jack? I'm here.
Let's go.

350
00:21:12,378 --> 00:21:14,246
Aah!
Gotcha, Lucy.

351
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:18,116
Just a matter of time.

352
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,617
Rick!

353
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:22,120
You scared the crap out of me.

354
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:26,724
Look, you couldn't
make the tasting...

355
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,227
I brought the tasting to you.

356
00:21:29,261 --> 00:21:32,096
Regi was in on this?
Yes.

357
00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:34,066
Was Jack, too?

358
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,901
Yes, everybody lied to you.

359
00:21:35,935 --> 00:21:38,437
Uh, it's called a surprise.

360
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:41,473
The normal human response
is shock, laughter,

361
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:43,875
jumping up and down, or you could
launch an investigation...

362
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,145
Okay, I get it. ...
Or establish a timeline.

363
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,347
Shut up.

364
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,288
I was a jerk
last night. Sorry.

365
00:21:55,322 --> 00:21:57,357
<i>No, I was... am.</i>

366
00:21:57,391 --> 00:21:59,592
I brought you and Jack
some clothes.

367
00:21:59,627 --> 00:22:02,362
Oh, you rock.

368
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:07,501
What's this?

369
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,672
Nothing.
It's just a scratch.

370
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:13,241
It's not happening again.
Is it?

371
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:15,277
What?

372
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:17,378
Chasing after a dead girl.

373
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:18,847
No, it's not.

374
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:25,820
New partner complaining again.

375
00:22:25,855 --> 00:22:27,622
He can wait.

376
00:22:27,657 --> 00:22:29,057
New partner.

377
00:22:29,092 --> 00:22:32,094
<i>I mean, the new guy.</i>

378
00:22:32,128 --> 00:22:33,762
Rick, come on.

379
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:36,065
I can't compete with a ghost.

380
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:38,634
<i>I mean, I can, right?
But I won't.</i>

381
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:41,938
You don't have to.

382
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:13,002
What time are Jack and regi
coming back?

383
00:23:13,036 --> 00:23:14,837
I sent them
to a French gangster film.

384
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:16,306
It's like five hours long.

385
00:23:17,642 --> 00:23:20,544
Jack should be
falling asleep...

386
00:23:20,578 --> 00:23:22,212
Right about now.

387
00:23:22,247 --> 00:23:25,882
You really
thought this through.

388
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:28,284
Are you gonna
put that gun away?

389
00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:32,021
Maybe.

390
00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:41,897
The service
will be about your daughter...

391
00:23:41,931 --> 00:23:43,933
The way she was meant
to be remembered.

392
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:45,668
We appreciate that, father.

393
00:23:45,702 --> 00:23:50,073
Have you thought about hymns?

394
00:23:50,107 --> 00:23:52,509
There are some very nice
selections in here.

395
00:23:52,543 --> 00:23:56,847
Maybe you could pick out a few
you'd like to consider.

396
00:23:56,882 --> 00:24:00,151
Yeah, yeah, I'll take a look.

397
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:13,730
Mitch.

398
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:19,235
You got any hymns
you want to hear?

399
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:26,675
We'll go with the usual, then.

400
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:30,580
I think I have
everything I need.

401
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:37,555
Your daughter is with God now,
Mrs. Larsen.

402
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:41,225
<i>He's watching over her...
over all of you.</i>

403
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,094
He always is.

404
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:57,440
What good is that to me?

405
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,210
She's not supposed to
be with God.

406
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:02,911
<i>She's supposed to be with me.</i>

407
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:05,848
Mitch, come on.

408
00:25:05,882 --> 00:25:09,418
My daughter...
she was out there alone.

409
00:25:09,452 --> 00:25:14,090
And she was scared and she
was hurt and she was alone.

410
00:25:15,826 --> 00:25:18,761
Tell me.

411
00:25:18,796 --> 00:25:21,631
Tell me, where was God then?

412
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:51,211
Look at this shit hole
of a waterfront.

413
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:53,381
<i>You know, there should be
a stadium there.</i>

414
00:25:53,415 --> 00:25:57,685
<i>My stadium.</i>

415
00:25:57,719 --> 00:26:01,922
Could you imagine hearing the
roar of the crowd from up here?

416
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:06,027
Gives me a hard-on
just thinking about it.

417
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:08,797
Another vanity project
like the mayor's.

418
00:26:08,831 --> 00:26:10,465
Afraid I can't help you.

419
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:13,034
Why are you here?

420
00:26:13,068 --> 00:26:16,404
'Cause Adams has been
robbing this city blind

421
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:18,073
for almost a decade.

422
00:26:18,107 --> 00:26:20,142
It is time for a change.

423
00:26:20,176 --> 00:26:22,377
Oh, man.

424
00:26:22,412 --> 00:26:24,847
How does a rich kid
from Connecticut

425
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:26,315
get right here, right now,

426
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:28,784
talking mumbo jumbo
about the underprivileged?

427
00:26:28,818 --> 00:26:34,790
25 years ago,
I took a ride on a bus.

428
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:36,892
I just never got off.

429
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:44,200
I get it.
You got to stay in character.

430
00:26:44,234 --> 00:26:46,169
I can respect that.

431
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,041
You know...Most politicians
are so in love

432
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:54,143
with the sound
of their own garbage,

433
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:56,746
they can't keep
their mouth shut.

434
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,414
I like you, Richmond.

435
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:00,617
As I said,
I'm not here to help you.

436
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:04,788
Well, maybe one day you will.

437
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:07,391
But for now, I want Adams
to go to his grave

438
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,260
pissing in his adult diaper,

439
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:13,430
knowing he lost this thing
because of me.

440
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:16,766
That alone will be worth it.

441
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:38,688
Stan!

442
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:48,630
What are we doing here?

443
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,602
Gonna have to sell it.

444
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:59,108
You bought this?

445
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:01,010
Serious?

446
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:05,682
Does Mitch know?

447
00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:09,785
Supposed to be a surprise.

448
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,922
Rosie never had a backyard.

449
00:28:17,694 --> 00:28:23,164
You want to do something
about that guy, that Richmond?

450
00:28:23,198 --> 00:28:27,101
Just say the word.
We'll take care of it.

451
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:28,735
Like old times.

452
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:32,973
I don't do that anymore.

453
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:03,805
Hey, girl.

454
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,611
How about you and I take a trip
down to the cage...

455
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:13,613
Have some fun...

456
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:15,648
Maybe squeeze
a nosebleed or two in?

457
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,818
Screw you, dickhead!

458
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:23,323
Remember, Sterling...
"no" means "yes."

459
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,354
Hi.

460
00:29:56,388 --> 00:29:58,990
Hi.

461
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:06,431
I'm so sorry,
Mrs. Larsen.

462
00:30:08,634 --> 00:30:12,737
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

463
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:21,512
When you saw her on Friday,
how was she?

464
00:30:21,547 --> 00:30:26,183
She looked...Happy.

465
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,094
Was she seeing anybody?

466
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,564
Anybody that she didn't
want us to know about?

467
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:46,069
I... I don't know.
I'm sorry.

468
00:31:00,184 --> 00:31:04,622
I have to go,
Mrs. Larsen.

469
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,857
Okay.

470
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,328
Okay.

471
00:31:11,363 --> 00:31:13,998
I'll see you?

472
00:31:14,032 --> 00:31:17,034
Yeah. Bye.

473
00:31:43,696 --> 00:31:44,896
Janek.

474
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:49,267
<i>Witam mój stary znajomy.</i>

475
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:53,571
I heard about Rosie.
My condolences.

476
00:32:04,982 --> 00:32:10,386
I bought a house
before all this.

477
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:16,459
I can't move my wife,
my kids now.

478
00:32:16,493 --> 00:32:18,394
I'm paying rent.
I got a mortgage.

479
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:20,296
I got funeral expenses.

480
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:29,841
For 17 years, you ignored me...

481
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:32,511
Walked right past me
on the street.

482
00:32:32,545 --> 00:32:34,747
You know why.

483
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:40,386
Forget it.

484
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,455
Wait.

485
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:53,866
Family always comes first.

486
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:03,677
We were never family.

487
00:33:06,181 --> 00:33:08,516
My best to Mitch.

488
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:39,348
Hey, Al.
It's all yours.

489
00:33:41,284 --> 00:33:44,620
Hey, humor me, man.

490
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:47,790
Have you ever seen this girl
on the bus?

491
00:33:47,824 --> 00:33:50,025
Yeah, I recognize her.
Seen her a few times.

492
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,428
You sure about that?

493
00:33:52,462 --> 00:33:53,830
Look around, son.

494
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:55,799
<i>Ain't a lot of white girls
on the end of this journey.</i>

495
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,201
You remember where she went?

496
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:01,004
End of the line.

497
00:35:35,588 --> 00:35:37,956
Mrs. Larsen?

498
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:44,663
Sorry, I don't, uh...
I don't mean to intrude.

499
00:35:44,697 --> 00:35:46,130
You mind?

500
00:35:46,165 --> 00:35:48,166
No. No.

501
00:35:48,201 --> 00:35:49,801
I'm Bennet.

502
00:36:00,512 --> 00:36:04,315
Rosie was a great kid.

503
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,785
Kids like her are, uh...

504
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:08,754
Why I got into teaching
in the first place.

505
00:36:08,788 --> 00:36:13,593
She was so smart
and, uh... and eager to learn.

506
00:36:17,098 --> 00:36:20,768
Rosie wanted, uh...

507
00:36:20,802 --> 00:36:23,237
She wanted the world, you know?

508
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:25,801
Mr. Larsen?

509
00:37:25,836 --> 00:37:29,907
The front door was open.

510
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:31,409
I hate to disturb you,

511
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:33,311
but I need to check
Rosie's room again

512
00:37:33,346 --> 00:37:35,547
to make sure
we didn't miss anything.

513
00:37:43,758 --> 00:37:48,561
I'm sorry about what happened
at the station.

514
00:37:48,596 --> 00:37:52,165
You said she didn't suffer.

515
00:38:02,677 --> 00:38:05,045
You should've told us.

516
00:38:25,232 --> 00:38:29,770
Rosie loved poetry, literature.

517
00:38:29,804 --> 00:38:33,341
Rosie wrote her semester paper
on this author.

518
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:36,278
This was her favorite book.

519
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,890
Sarah?

520
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,996
She's not here.
Get used to it.

521
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,806
So, you thought you'd help
yourself to our wedding cake?

522
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,411
Well, it was here.

523
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:10,280
Think we can do it?

524
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:12,650
Do what?

525
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,255
Eat it all.

526
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:20,258
That's right.

527
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:29,933
Come on.
I can't do this solo.

528
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,106
Yeah.
Chocolate raspberry filling.

529
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,876
Mmm.
How's the white ganache?

530
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,379
It's okay.
Yeah?

531
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:45,248
Mmm.
Feeling it?

532
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:46,983
Feeling what?

533
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,318
The sugar rush.

534
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:51,621
Kind of. Whatever.

535
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:57,154
I'm in.

536
00:40:57,189 --> 00:40:59,958
Adams admit
to planting the leak yet?

537
00:40:59,992 --> 00:41:02,827
Not yet.

538
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:05,496
Give me some time.

539
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:08,566
You know where to find me.

540
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:10,301
Hey.

541
00:41:11,871 --> 00:41:13,638
How'd you know it wasn't me?

542
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:18,008
Because if you wanted
to screw me,

543
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:20,144
you'd have found
a smarter way to do it.

544
00:41:57,713 --> 00:41:59,147
Excuse me, gentlemen,

545
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:01,582
detective holden
from Seattle PD

546
00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:04,151
I'm looking for this girl.

547
00:42:04,186 --> 00:42:06,254
Have you seen her around?

548
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:08,222
Yeah, I've seen her.

549
00:42:08,257 --> 00:42:10,124
She come here
with that guy over there...

550
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:13,228
In the photo.
