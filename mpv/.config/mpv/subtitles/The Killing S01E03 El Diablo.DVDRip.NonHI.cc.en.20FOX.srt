1
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,870
Councilman, when are you going
to be withdrawing from the race?

2
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,863
Councilman!

3
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,209
Councilman, did you know the
murder victim, Rosie Larsen?

4
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:20,435
No, I did not. Who was driving
the vehicle she was found in?

5
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:24,072
Rosie Larsen's body was found in the
trunk of a car stolen from this campaign.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,118
The police have asked
me not to comment further.

7
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:28,877
Does this remind you of what
happened to your wife, Councilman?

8
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:33,314
This has nothing
to do with that.

9
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:38,920
A young woman has been
killed... someone's child.

10
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:42,223
This is not political. It's about us
doing all we can to help the police...

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,193
solve a senseless
and brutal crime.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,001
My heart goes out to the
Larsen family for their terrible loss.

13
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:56,229
Mr. Councilman!

14
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,147
This was some party
they were havin' down here.

15
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,884
Meth, oxy, booze.

16
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:34,986
Blood's a match to Rosie's type.

17
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,905
Larsen girl a user?

18
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:40,386
Won't get the tox screen back
for a few days. Didn't seem like it.

19
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,421
But if she was, could
have been an O.D.

20
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:44,607
Whoever was with her
panicked, dumped her.

21
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,716
I need you to work this thing,
Sarah. Can't do it. You know that.

22
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:50,985
It's gonna take some delicate
maneuvering. He can't do it.

23
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:54,055
I'm not staying. Just
till the end of the week.

24
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:56,016
I got City Hall on my
ass on this thing. You

25
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,825
can't leave this with
him. You know that.

26
00:02:57,894 --> 00:03:01,380
Not my problem anymore.
Well, it is your problem, actually.

27
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,015
You're on the city's dime
till the end of the week.

28
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,285
Look,

29
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,255
clear this thing, and I'm just
an address on a Christmas card.

30
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,918
Principal Meyers.

31
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,502
Oh, my God.

32
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,924
- Hey!
- Councilman!

33
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,468
Damn it! You shouldn't have
listened to the cop. I told you.

34
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:43,066
That dead girl's gonna
lead the 10:00 news...

35
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,206
and be on the front page
of every paper in the state.

36
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:47,843
Where is he? You
lying son of a bitch!

37
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:49,777
Ruth. Why didn't you tell me?

38
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:51,508
Because the police
asked me not to.

39
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,676
The car was stolen. It
had nothing to do with us.

40
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,052
What, you think they care? This
is what those parasites feed on.

41
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,833
Chappaquiddick? Chandra
Levy? Ring any bells?

42
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:01,801
We can control
this, Ruth. Shut up!

43
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,220
By the time those whores
are finished with you,

44
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,405
you're gonna be the
punch line of a dirty joke.

45
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,908
- I've had about enough of this.
- Ruth, we can talk this through.

46
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:11,310
We can get through
this. "We"? "We"?

47
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:15,454
Oh, no. There's
no we. <i>We</i> are over.

48
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,704
We kept sports equipment
down here years ago.

49
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,146
The kids called it "The Cage."
It hasn't been used in ages.

50
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,405
Who else has keys to
this place? Besides me?

51
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,441
Just our janitor.

52
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,795
Damn.

53
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,663
Front-row seat.

54
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,693
What's his name? The janitor.

55
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,077
Lyndon Johnson Rosales. Why?

56
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:48,870
Thanks.

57
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,397
I'm hungry. Aunt
Terry's getting Chinese.

58
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,321
I hate Chinese.

59
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,802
Okay. Let's see
what else we got here.

60
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,976
How 'bout tuna fish?

61
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:13,528
I hate tuna.

62
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:18,867
Okay.

63
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:23,571
What do you boys want for
dinner? Chocolate-chip pancakes.

64
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,874
Pancakes are
for breakfast, idiot!

65
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:27,842
Don't call your brother that.

66
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,061
We can have pancakes.

67
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,609
Chocolate-chip pancakes.
All right. Here we go.

68
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:36,067
Should we wake up Mom? No,
let Mom sleep. She's tired, Den.

69
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,904
We can make dinner ourselves, right?
You know how to make them, Dad?

70
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:42,607
It's gotta be on the back of
the box. How hard can it be?

71
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,377
Get me an egg and
some milk, Tom. Okay.

72
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:55,036
Okay.

73
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,265
Go ahead. Crack that
egg right in there, huh?

74
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,760
All right. Ooh!

75
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,097
Yup. You like crunchy ones, huh?

76
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,199
There you go.

77
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,491
How did Rosie die?

78
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,785
It's okay, Dad.

79
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,338
You don't have to talk about it.

80
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,739
So how long you
staying this time?

81
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,142
You like the L.T.'s pet?

82
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,644
Maybe he just wants
the case cleared.

83
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,180
Maybe I didn't just
find the crime scene.

84
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,827
Assumptions are
your enemy, Detective.

85
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:02,154
I'm lead on this for
the next few days,

86
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:06,291
so stop pressing everyone we
question like they're in the box.

87
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,172
Let go of the idea that you
have some B.S. detector.

88
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,830
And how do you know I
don't have one of those?

89
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,677
'Cause you're dressed like Justin
Bieber and eat pork rinds for dinner.

90
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,319
Ooh! Me and your kid
got the same diet, Linden.

91
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,866
Ma'am.

92
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,113
We're with the Seattle P.D.

93
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,699
We're looking for a
Lyndon Johnson Rosales.

94
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,806
No. No here.

95
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,155
We'd like to ask you a few
questions. Can we come in?

96
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:06,968
Is Lyndon your son?

97
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:09,637
Does he live here with you? N...

98
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:14,241
- No Lyndon here.
- No.

99
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,411
He's... He's not here?

100
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,382
'Cause we could... we
could wait. You go, please.

101
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:32,827
We need to talk to your son.

102
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:35,196
Lyndon no come.

103
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,399
But we can wait if he's
not here. Lyndon no here.

104
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:42,670
Mr. Rosales?

105
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,824
Holder, he's here!

106
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,544
- Put your weapon down
right now!
- Lyndon!

107
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:26,247
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!

108
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,716
Mr. Rosales, we just
want to talk to you.

109
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:31,952
Lyndon! Lyndon!

110
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,444
Twenty-nine-year-old male
fell from a third-story window.

111
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,613
L.O.C. on arrival.
Depressed skull fracture.

112
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,527
This man's a suspect in a murder
case. When can I talk to him?

113
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,418
After surgery.

114
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,308
<i>Councilman, did you know the
murder victim, Rosie Larsen?</i>

115
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:57,078
<i>Who was driving the
vehicle she was found in?</i>

116
00:09:57,147 --> 00:10:01,082
<i>Rosie Larsen's body was found in the
trunk of a car stolen from this campaign.</i>

117
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,431
<i>The police have asked
me not to comment further.</i>

118
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,444
<i>Dr. Barnes to C.C.U.</i>

119
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:17,031
So Rosales likes to show
his junk to teenage girls.

120
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:20,701
Damn.

121
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,272
And he's got a kid-tiddlin'
record and a couple of 311's.

122
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:27,342
School missed it.
That's why he ran.

123
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:29,939
'Cause of his warrants or
because he killed the Larsen girl?

124
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,330
L.B.J.'s alibi'd Friday night.

125
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,499
He got picked up at 9:30. D.U.I.

126
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,502
He spent the weekend
in the drunk tank.

127
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,437
Ouch.

128
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,042
Thanks.

129
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:47,223
Keep an eye on Rosales for me.
Call me as soon as he's awake.

130
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,347
Yeah.

131
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,040
<i>Hey, babe.</i> Hi.
What are you doing?

132
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:02,043
Watching M.M.A.
with Leon. <i>That's good.</i>

133
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:04,457
As long as there's someone
there to keep you warm,

134
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:07,161
I won't feel so guilty about
staying through the weekend.

135
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,230
- Rick?
<i>- </i>

136
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,033
So much for "I'm gonna be on
the next flight tomorrow," huh?

137
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:16,691
I'm under a lot of pressure.

138
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,994
Baby, I found the girl. Oakes
wants me to see it through.

139
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,197
Great.

140
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,550
We'll be there Sunday for the
party. I don't care what he does.

141
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,188
Good... because we're
still getting married, right?

142
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,106
Of course.

143
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:34,742
<i>And when you get married,
there's lots of crap you gotta do,</i>

144
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,845
like the cake, the flowers, the
streamers... crap you said you cared about.

145
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:39,997
I do care. You know I care.

146
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,269
I'll make this up
to you. I promise.

147
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,789
Just try to get on the plane next
time. I gotta go. Leon's getting jealous.

148
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:49,506
I love you.

149
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:54,412
<i>Put on a little more muscle.
Maybe that's the difference.</i>

150
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,711
Hey.

151
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,681
Leftover minestrone
on the stove,

152
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,916
and you don't have to
worry about waking him up.

153
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:35,319
Five hours of Halo knocked
him on his butt. Thanks, Regi.

154
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,489
How's that quittin'
smokin' goin'? It's fine.

155
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:42,526
He wanted to wait up, but I told
him he had to go to school tomorrow.

156
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,495
He's not happy.

157
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:47,331
I could let him smoke
cigarettes all day on the dock,

158
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,520
but I thought school
might be a little better.

159
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,703
That's what you were
doing when you were his age.

160
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,871
A lot more than
that. Yeah, I know.

161
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,729
I want a little more
for Jack than that.

162
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:03,114
Sonoma will be a
fresh start. He'll love it.

163
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,833
It'll be great. I bet.

164
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:13,307
So what's holding
you back? Nothing.

165
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,626
Work.

166
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:18,295
I thought work was over.

167
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,832
So did I.

168
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,572
I gotta get back. I'm just
gonna take a little shower.

169
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:30,258
Okay. I got clean

I got my two favorite people in the
whole world for a couple more days.

Great seeing you again.

188

Now, we're having a little
party. I'll phone you about it.

189
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,882
Thank you very much for coming.

190
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:38,011
If Cicero had bided his
time, he would have gone far.

191
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,581
Instead, the Romans
executed him.

192
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,878
Put his hands and head
on display in the Forum.

193
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,536
You needed to see me, Mayor?

194
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:49,574
It's unfortunate what happened with
your campaign car and that girl, Darren.

195
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,320
I'd say the race is pretty
much over for you at this point.

196
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,630
But all is not lost. Wait four
years, you'll have my endorsement.

197
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:58,977
Donors will flee, you lose
this time. No second chances.

198
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:02,586
So you can get on your knees for
four more years for the developers?

199
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:06,357
I don't think so. No
need to wallow, Darren.

200
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:10,794
You didn't really think the police would
keep this thing a secret from me, did you?

201
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,449
Holder, I got the yearbook
from Principal Meyers.

202
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,618
I'm on my way over.

203
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,223
We had a deal. We did.

204
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,320
Then what the hell is
this? It didn't come from us.

205
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:43,827
Who did it come
from? I don't know.

206

I played fair with you. I know
you did. I appreciate that.

My campaign is in the gutter
now because I trusted you.

208
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,001
What can I do? Make an arrest.

He's conscious, but he's

234
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,337
And no visitors.

235
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,506
She's a prison guard.

I got pica when I was, like, five?

240

They had to keep the
Play-Doh locked up around me.

Mr. Rosales? Can you hear me?

00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:07,071
I'm sorry this happened to you.

244
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,758
We know why you ran, but that's
not why I need to talk to you right now.

245
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:14,544
I know that sometimes you watch
the kids in the basement at school.

246
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,463
That's not my concern.

247
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:21,268
What I need to know is if
you saw this girl, Rosie Larsen,

248
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:23,454
in the basement Friday night.

249
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,775
Helping us can help
you, Mr. Rosales.

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,313
You saw Rosie

Yes.

- Look, you two

- Hey, chill.

Don't tell me to

260
00:20:57,407 --> 00:21:00,741
He was in the basement

261
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:03,227

But for now, and most
importantly, for the people of Seattle,

270
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:35,192
I think what we really need
to do is take a deep breath...

271
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,227
and stay the course.

272
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,896

I checked Jamie and Gwen's accounts.
No e-mails about the Larsen girl.

288

00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:13,670
I trusted him.

337
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,389
He doesn't care.
He just wants to win.

338
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,743
What are we gonna do?

339
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,095
Hey. Ready to play some hoops?

340
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,748
We gotta be at the park
at 5:00 for that press thing.

341
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,750
Any luck with the Larsen family?

342
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:29,269
They're not answering our calls.

343
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,172
All right. Maybe we
can butter 'em up.

344
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:35,024
Send 'em some
roses. White roses.

345
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,427
No. No flowers.

346
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:40,314
Flowers die.

347
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,922
She drowned?

348
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,160
Rosie drowned?

349
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:30,481
I thought you should know.

350
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:51,601
We had to find out about
that politician in the paper.

351
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,766
I know. I'm sorry. That
shouldn't have happened.

352
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:59,776
Did he... Is he
the one who did it?

353
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:03,029
All that we know right now is
that the campaign had a lot of cars.

354
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,660
That particular one was reported
stolen on Saturday morning.

355
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,734
So you haven't
arrested anybody yet?

356
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:10,170
We are working
on it, Mr. Larsen.

357
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:14,591
There's a couple of things that have
come up that I need to ask you about.

358
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:17,311
Did Rosie ever mention
a Kris Echols to you?

359
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:20,096
He lived down the street.

360
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:23,166
Him and Rosie used to play
together when they were little. Why?

361
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,418
Did Rosie keep
in touch with him?

362
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:27,337
No. It was a long time ago.

363
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:31,258
He and his family moved away from
the neighborhood, like, three years ago.

364
00:28:31,327 --> 00:28:34,745
- He had problems. Drugs, I think.
- What about Rosie?

365
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:38,432
Did she ever drink or use drugs?

366
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:40,384
No.

367
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:43,837
Why are you asking that?

368
00:28:43,906 --> 00:28:45,622
We're throwing a wide net,

369
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,668
looking at everybody your
daughter associated with.

370
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,626
No particular reason.

371
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:52,463
- He seemed like a good kid.
- Yeah.

372
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,291
Did she suffer?

373
00:29:08,197 --> 00:29:11,014
We think that she was probably
unconscious when the car went in,

374
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,316
so, no.

375
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:21,219
All right, Aman. You ready
for your final beatdown?

376
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:23,810
If I thought one was coming.

377
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:33,953
Yeah! Twenty-one! Oh,
yeah! Nothing but net, D.R.!

378
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,323
We need to wrap
it up, Councilman.

379
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:38,258
Next time, Aman,

380
00:29:38,327 --> 00:29:40,827
you won't know what hit you.

381
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:43,296
All right. Glad you guys
got to see this in action.

382
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,533
This All Stars Program is
in 35 parks around the city...

383
00:29:46,602 --> 00:29:49,936
and a key component to Councilman
Richmond's anti-gang initiative.

384
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:52,000
Is it true Councilwoman Yitanes
has pulled her endorsement...

385
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:54,875
because of the Larsen murder?

386
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:56,888
No comments? What about the car?

387
00:29:56,912 --> 00:30:00,346
Any news on who was driving
the car the girl was found in?

388
00:30:00,415 --> 00:30:03,016
Uh, how would we know?
The car was stolen...

389
00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:05,752
Okay. Thanks a lot,
guys. We'll be in touch.

390
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:08,021
Councilman...

391
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,835
Don't give them any more fodder,
Darren. Let this thing burn itself out.

392
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:13,760
That won't happen, Jamie.
There's a leak in the campaign.

393
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:20,033
Yeah. Someone tipped off the
press about Yitanes's endorsement.

394
00:30:20,102 --> 00:30:22,002
And now this?

395
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,854
The cops leaked this. They
never keep their mouths shut.

396
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,224
And Yitanes probably
blabbed herself.

397
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,759
Everybody's playing
both sides now, Darren.

398
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,696
It's the name of the game.

399
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,198
Yeah? Hey, you stay focused.

400
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:38,151
We got 23 days to
turn this thing around.

401
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:42,155
We can do it. Hell,
we're gonna do it.

402
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:44,123
We always have, right?

403
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:48,745
Kris started using
drugs when he was 13.

404
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:51,982
First it was pot.
Then... I don't know.

405
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:55,184
The meth started when
he was in high school.

406
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,253
Where's your son now?

407
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,858
Last time I did try to get him some
help, I found him at Marginal Way.

408
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:03,093
You know that horrible
place by the bridge?

409
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:06,763
I don't know what
he did this time,

410
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,748
and I don't want to know.

411
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:11,679
Maybe you could remember that
he has a mother that loves him...

412
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,488
and who prays
for him every night.

413
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,341
They all do.

414
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,288
Yo, man. Can I get some of that?

415
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,457
Nope.

416
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,766
Man, what a dick.

417
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,034
Got a light?

418
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,810
I'm lookin' for some shards.

419
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,863
I heard Kris is a hookup.

420
00:31:56,932 --> 00:31:58,798
You a cop?

421
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,455
I look like a cop?

422
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,457
Are you a cop?

423
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,897
So what's up? Is he here?

424
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,300
No.

425
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,236
Maybe later.

426
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,200
Can I get some of that?

427
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:58,958
He ain't here.

428
00:33:02,797 --> 00:33:05,898
Relax, Mom.

429
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:07,867
It's NarcScent.

430
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,555
Smells like weed, tastes
like weed, it ain't weed.

431
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:15,108
Used it on busts all the time.

432
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,078
What did Green Hair say?

433
00:33:19,147 --> 00:33:23,282
No Rosie sightings, but she said
Kris is a regular, so he'll be here.

434
00:33:26,821 --> 00:33:29,605
Skate park's walking distance
to the campaign parking lot.

435
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,914
He could've stolen
that car Friday night.

436
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,395
Yeah. Get cozy, Linden.

437
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,732
We gotta wait.

438
00:33:55,984 --> 00:33:58,401
<i>Found a way to lure
Yitanes back to our camp.</i>

439
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,237
Really? Her husband.

440
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,605
The plumber?
Plumbing contractor.

441
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,741
Been a dead weight
on her ass for years.

442
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,155
- Didn't that guy
have his license revoked?
- No, just suspended.

443
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,579
- Paid a little fine. No biggie.
- So?

444
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:12,732
So, remember the teen
shelters Yitanes is sponsoring?

445
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,151
They're gonna
need toilets, right?

446
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,500
She can't give her
husband the job, but you can.

447
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,591
So I trade my rubber
stamp for her endorsement?

448
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,821
Come on, Darren. Some
plumber's gonna get the job anyway.

449
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:25,807
Why shouldn't
you benefit from it?

450
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:28,671
It's interesting how you're so
worried about our chances now.

451
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,550
What are you
talking about? Gwen.

452
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:34,103
We saw the e-mail, Jamie.

453
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,306
What e-mail?

454
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,966
Okay, this is bullshit.

455
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:51,004
I never wrote this. Obviously
someone has hacked into my account.

456
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,425
Don't I even get a chance
to defend myself here?

457
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:57,577
You just did.

458
00:34:58,813 --> 00:35:01,030
I don't believe this.

459
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,101
You're letting sex
cloud your judgment.

460
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,554
- Jamie, enough.
- Screw you.

461
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,824
Screw both of you.

462
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,319
Hey.

463
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:27,240
I thought I was gonna be back
by dinner, but, um, I'm still working.

464
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:30,860
You and Regi gonna do takeout?

465
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:34,113
Great. Don't forget
to tell her thanks.

466
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:37,416
Hey, Jack, no soda.
You'll be up all night.

467
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:39,369
Okay.

468
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:46,976
Chill, Linden.

469
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:51,764
I mean, I never had dinner
with my mom, and... look at me.

470
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,867
That's comforting.

471
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:04,160
Kinda young to be out here
alone. How old do you think she is?

472
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,631
Fourteen goin' on
40, like the rest of 'em.

473
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,638
Hey, check it out.

474
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:27,384
Later, man. What's up, Kris?

475
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,519
<i>♪♪</i>

476
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,769
What the hell, man?
Need to talk to you.

477
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,473
Yeah? I don't need to
talk to you, 5-0. Yeah?

478
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:41,242
We're taking you in. On what
grounds? I know my rights.

479
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:45,084
You gonna arrest
me? Didn't think so.

480
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:48,237
We know you were at Fort
Washington Friday night at the dance.

481
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,706
Whatevs. I'm out. What
did you do to Rosie, Kris?

482
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,259
I don't know what
you're talking about.

483
00:36:53,328 --> 00:36:55,573
You gave her some bad shit.

484
00:36:55,597 --> 00:36:57,809
She O.D.'d down in that
hellhole, and then you freaked.

485
00:36:57,833 --> 00:36:59,866
Get off me! Let him go.

486
00:36:59,935 --> 00:37:02,735
I said let him go, Holder.

487
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,297
Your mom says hi!

488
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,232
Dickhead.

489
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,120
Now what?

490
00:37:21,189 --> 00:37:23,072
Let's go.

491
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:31,292
Why did you tell people I'm
still considering endorsing you?

492
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,861
Because I'm still
hoping you will.

493
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:36,586
Did I not make
myself clear last night?

494
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:39,973
You are the kind of liability
I need like a kick in the ass.

495
00:37:40,042 --> 00:37:42,186
Maybe. But I have a proposition.

496
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,110
Sit down, Ruth. No.

497
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:47,480
I'll be out here if you need me.

498
00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:51,601
You may not need me, but I
understand your husband might.

499
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,336
What are you talking about?

500
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,816
The multimillion-dollar teen
shelter program you've sponsored?

501
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,508
No. No. I don't need
you to make that happen.

502
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:02,812
No. But you need me to insure that
Yitanes and Sons do all the plumbing.

503
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:07,783
Wow! How far the
mighty have fallen.

504
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:10,486
You're surprising
me here, Darren.

505
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:15,241
I need your sway with the
unions to win this election.

506
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:17,521
