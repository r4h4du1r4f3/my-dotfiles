1
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,166
<i>Hi. My name's Orion.</i>

2
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,041
<i>I'm a kid, just like you,
so we have that in common.</i>

3
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,583
<i>Anyhow, I saw you sitting there
by yourself</i>

4
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,208
<i>and thought maybe you'd like some company.</i>

5
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,625
<i>I know I would.</i>

6
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,416
<i>So that's why I'm walking up to you
right now and...</i>

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,583
<i>Walking right past you.</i>

8
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:46,250
<i>Why, you ask?</i>

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,666
<i>Because, Sally,</i>

10
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,125
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

11
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:54,041
<i>Afraid of what, you want to know?
So much, really.</i>

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,791
<i>But in this case,
rejection, humiliation...</i>

13
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:04,500
<i>that you might tell your friends,
and they would all laugh at me.</i>

14
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:07,041
<i>And it's not just you
I'm afraid of, Sally.</i>

15
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,208
<i>And not just girls in general.</i>

16
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,666
<i>It's most things, to be candid.</i>

17
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>Oh, it's tuna. What do you have?</i>

18
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,458
<i>It would be kinda nice to know.</i>

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,166
<i>The school counselor told me
to document my fears in some form.</i>

20
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,083
<i>That's why I keep a sketchbook.</i>

21
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,208
<i>It's my way of trying to manage my issues.</i>

22
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:35,833
<i>Take page 14, for example.
My fear of clogging the toilet...</i>

23
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:38,833
<i>...and flooding the whole entire school.</i>

24
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:42,833
Oh, thank God.

25
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:46,083
<i>I'm also afraid of giving
the wrong answer in class.</i>

26
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:49,875
Who can tell me
which explorer first reached India by sea?

27
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,833
- Me, me, me!
<i>- A tricky situation.</i>

28
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,958
<i>Mrs. Spinoza usually calls on kids
who don't raise their hands.</i>

29
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:58,458
<i>But raising my hand so she won't
call on me is a dangerous strategy.</i>

30
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:02,250
<i>Therefore I try to look invisible.
But at the same time, not too invisible.</i>

31
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,125
<i>I know the answer is Vasco da Gama.</i>

32
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,875
<i>It's the answer to a great many questions
in the fifth grade,</i>

33
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:10,166
{\an8}<i>but I'm afraid if called on,
I might say "Gasco da Vama",</i>

34
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,625
{\an8}<i>or "Dasco ga Vama."</i>

35
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,875
<i>Everyone would laugh.</i>

36
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,750
Oh, Mrs. Spinoza, I know!

37
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,208
Yes? Lisa?

38
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,708
- Vasco da Gama.
- Very good, Lisa.

39
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,250
<i>I'm not a real big fan of Lisa.</i>

40
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,375
<i>But to be fair,</i>

41
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,416
<i>there are a lot of things
I'm not a big fan of.</i>

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,666
<i>Murderous gutter clowns
are high on my list.</i>

43
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,833
<i>Cell phone waves giving me cancer.</i>

44
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:34,791
Hi, Grandma.

45
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,666
<i>Mosquito bites getting infected.</i>

46
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,250
<i>Falling off a skyscraper.</i>

47
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,333
<i>- Saying "good morning."</i>
- "Goob dorning!"

48
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,500
<i>Bees. Dogs. The ocean.</i>

49
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,750
<i>I'm afraid of being responsible
for my team losing.</i>

50
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,875
Hey, Orion, catch!

51
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,958
<i>And of course,
I'm afraid of locker rooms.</i>

52
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,916
<i>Because A, what sane person isn't?</i>

53
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,750
You okay, Gabe?

54
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,625
<i>And B...</i>

55
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,750
<i>...Richie Panici.</i>

56
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:09,625
Well, well, well, look who it is.
Cryin' Orion!

57
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,333
Hey, Richie.

58
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,458
Wear pants much?

59
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,375
<i>I'm afraid of being humiliated
by Richie Panici.</i>

60
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,833
<i>Afraid of being punched by him.</i>

61
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,500
<i>Also, I'm afraid of...
Okay, what if I punch him back?</i>

62
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,208
<i>And his nose goes into his brain,
and he dies.</i>

63
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,875
<i>That can happen, the nose
and the brain thing. Look it up.</i>

64
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,309
<i>I'll go to juvie.</i>

65
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,166
<i>Plus, I'll have to live
with the guilt of...</i>

66
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,000
Hey! I asked if you wear pants much.
Don't be rude.

67
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,833
Yes, I do wear pants.

68
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,166
Much?

69
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,458
Uh...

70
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,291
What's that pad you always got?

71
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:52,666
"I'm afraid of monsters,
bees, haircuts, dogs...

72
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,500
the ocean, Richie Panici..."
Hey! I'm famous! Thanks!

73
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:01,708
Wait. You drew me dead!
No one draws me dead!

74
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:06,083
I'm hereby "consificating" this
on account of its rudeness to me,

75
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,000
Richie Panici.

76
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,333
<i>If I weren't so scared,
I would tell you that that's my property.</i>

77
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,083
<i>That I put my heart and soul into it,</i>

78
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,250
<i>and that you had no right
to grab it from me.</i>

79
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,208
<i>I would also tell you
that the word is "confiscating."</i>

80
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,666
Thank you, Richie.

81
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,416
- Huh?
- Huh?

82
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,666
Whatever.

83
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,208
<i>I don't know why I thanked him.</i>

84
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,833
Have a great weekend, everyone.

85
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:41,166
Oh, and don't forget to leave
your permission slips on my desk.

86
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,083
The bus for the planetarium leaves
on Monday at nine a.m. sharp.

87
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,916
<i>Oh, no. I was hoping Mrs. Spinoza
would've forgotten about the field trip.</i>

88
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,291
Ah, this is gonna be so fun!

89
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,375
<i>Fun? It sounds fun to you, Lisa?</i>

90
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,916
<i>Are you insane?
This field trip sounds terrifying.</i>

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,541
<i>Getting packed like sardines
into a rusty school bus</i>

92
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,875
<i>with 30 other kids
speeding down the highway?</i>

93
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,125
<i>Sounds like a traffic accident
waiting to happen.</i>

94
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,041
<i>I should know.</i>

95
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,434
<i>I've studied the actuarial charts.</i>

96
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,333
<i>And all those giant models of
our solar system hanging from the ceiling?</i>

97
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,336
<i>I mean, how long
have those things been up there?</i>

98
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,833
<i>A hundred years?</i>

99
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:23,208
<i>Plus, what if I end up having
to sit next to Sally at the planetarium,</i>

100
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,291
<i>and our hands touch?</i>

101
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,041
<i>I'll have a panic attack.</i>

102
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,083
<i>It'll become a running joke
around the school,</i>

103
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:31,208
<i>and I'll never know the joy
of a meaningful human connection!</i>

104
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,500
Orion, do you have your permission slip?

105
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,416
<i>I was afraid
she was gonna say that.</i>

106
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,000
Um, my parents won't let me go
to the planetarium.

107
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,458
Yeah, they don't believe in, uh, space.

108
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,666
Yeah, um, it's a whole thing.

109
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,875
She's over here.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,200
Hey, Orion.

111
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,541
I'm super excited for the field trip.

112
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,000
Uh...

113
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:10,208
So, um, I was wondering
if maybe you wanted to sit together?

114
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,666
While we're there?

115
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,041
<i>If I weren't so scared,
I'd tell you, "Of course I do, Sally.</i>

116
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,559
<i>Of course I wanna hang out with you.</i>

117
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,708
<i>To be frank, I've never wanted
anything more, but to do that,</i>

118
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,291
<i>I'd have to be able to not constantly
obsess over every negative thing</i>

119
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,851
<i>that could possibly happen..."</i>

120
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,375
Oh, that's my mom. I gotta go.

121
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,375
See you at the planetarium, Orion!

122
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,916
<i>No, you won't.</i>

123
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,208
<i>Page 17 in my sketch book.</i>

124
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,666
<i>I'm afraid my parents will move away
while I'm at school.</i>

125
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,791
<i>I don't know why I fear this.</i>

126
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,166
<i>The counselor at school
doesn't have any theories.</i>

127
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,041
<i>My parents certainly seem
nice enough, he says.</i>

128
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,166
<i>And I think he's correct.</i>

129
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,750
Hi, honey!

130
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,083
- Hi, Mom.
- How was school?

131
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,458
- Fine.
- I made you oatmeal cookies.

132
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,250
Oh, uh...

133
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,208
how'd that get there?

134
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,041
Your father found it
stuffed under the couch.

135
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,750
I think you mean
in between the couch cushions?

136
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,083
- Hm. Wanna talk about it?
- Not really.

137
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,208
You should go. It'll be fun.

138
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,416
I'm not so sure about that.

139
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,333
Orion, bud, I get it.

140
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,041
These kind of things can be scary.

141
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,625
But that's the thing.
It's okay to be nervous.

142
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,833
More than okay, in fact. It's normal.

143
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:54,750
The trick is not to let your fear
get in the way of living your life.

144
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,666
It's true.

145
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,958
Otherwise, I never would've proposed.

146
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:02,750
Sometimes, you just have
to feel the fear and do it anyway.

147
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,708
<i>I love my parents,
and I appreciate</i>

148
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,583
<i>what they're trying to do, but...</i>

149
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:12,250
<i>that is, without question,
the worst advice I've ever heard.</i>

150
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,458
<i>It looks like this is
the end of the line for us, guys.</i>

151
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,083
<i>Oh, no. This is terrible.</i>

152
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,166
<i>This cartoon
is completely unrealistic.</i>

153
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,208
<i>Recyclable items
do not have eyes or personalities.</i>

154
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:31,833
<i>They do not go on adventures.
I don't appreciate being condescended to.</i>

155
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,208
<i>Real life is way more
complicated than that.</i>

156
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,541
<i>- And reincarnation is wishful thinking.
- Wow!</i>

157
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,184
<i>For plastic containers
and people.</i>

158
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:43,208
<i>In real life, when you're dead,
you're dead.</i>

159
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,958
<i>The realization that there's no way
around it terrifies me.</i>

160
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,625
{\an8}<i>I try to imagine what death is like.
I've concluded it's like nothing.</i>

161
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:58,708
<i>I try to imagine nothing.
This is black and silent, not nothing.</i>

162
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,875
<i>Blackness and silence is something.</i>

163
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,458
<i>Nothing is perhaps
the one unimaginable thing.</i>

164
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,458
Orion!

165
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,000
Bedtime.

166
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,125
- All tucked in?
- Yes.

167
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,500
- Teeth brushed?
- Uh-huh.

168
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,125
All right, buddy. Sleep well.

169
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,500
Goodnight, Orion.

170
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,916
Uh... Wait!

171
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,333
Um, how about a quick bedtime story?

172
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,791
You know,

173
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,166
for old times' sake.

174
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,666
Orion, we've talked about this.

175
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,833
Here's a good one. Nice and weighty.
Perfect for bedtime.

176
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:49,333
Um, I'm not sure we have the time
for David Foster Wallace tonight.

177
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,791
Okay.

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,708
You know,
we'll always be here for you, Orion.

179
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,916
But please, stay in bed tonight?
Mom and I need our sleep.

180
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,458
Okay, I will. But...

181
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,708
could you at least
leave the door open tonight?

182
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,666
All right, bud. Say when.

183
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,833
Okay. A little more open?

184
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,625
Here okay?

185
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,666
Actually, a little more.

186
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,750
- Here?
- Good! Yes!

187
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,750
Actually, just a tad bit more?

188
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,666
- Thanks.
- Goodnight, sweetie.

189
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,166
- Goodnight, son.
- Night, Mom. Night, Dad.

190
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,458
Okay. This isn't so bad.

191
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,458
I take it back!

192
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,666
This is bad! Very, very bad!
It's literally the worst!

193
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,000
Because of all the things I'm afraid of,

194
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,125
I'm most afraid of the dark.

195
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh, no.

196
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,750
<i>It's an old house. Houses settle.</i>

197
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,291
<i>Nothing to worry about.</i>

198
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,309
<i>My parents have work in the morning.
They need their rest.</i>

199
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,791
<i>Can't I just put myself
in their shoes for once?</i>

200
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,833
No! No, no, no, no! No!

201
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,833
Curse you, darkness!

202
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:46,333
What cruel aberrations hide
within your inky cloak of... darkness?

203
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,416
Why can't you just leave me alone?

204
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,375
Alone... Alone...

205
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,875
Okay! That's it! I've had it with you!

206
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,666
Every single night
with the constant screaming

207
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,875
and the carrying on and whatnot!

208
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,541
Seven nights a week, 365 nights a year.

209
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,958
It's nonstop!

210
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,416
- What are you?
- Isn't that obvious?

211
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,458
The room's dark. It's dark out.
Hello? I'm Dark. Ta-da!

212
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,958
There it is again.

213
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,916
You know, there are a lot of people
that are scared of me.

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,125
But you,
you're on a whole different level.

215
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,500
Of all the kids
who are terrified of the dark,

216
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,291
you are by far the loudest,

217
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,541
the most obnoxious,
and frankly, the most hurtful.

218
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,041
And that's no small feat.

219
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,041
You've got
some pretty healthy competition.

220
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,291
{\an8}Check it out.

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,125
Millions of people are afraid of the dark.

222
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,750
- You're keeping a list?
- Yes, I'm keeping a list.

223
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,916
Do you know how many kids
are afraid of me?

224
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,625
It's giving me a complex.

225
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,625
This is just volume one, by the way.

226
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,333
Dark doesn't exist!
Dark doesn't exist!

227
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:19,750
Then why are you having
a conversation with me?

228
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,916
You know what I mean.
Dark is simply the absence of light.

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,166
Not a stupid cartoon character.

230
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,208
Here we go.

231
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:35,833
Look, you humans have always had
weird ways of conceptualizing me.

232
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,583
I'm not listening to you. You know why?
Because you're not real!

233
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,166
Oh, I'm very real.

234
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,708
Here, check it out.
I even made a little movie about myself.

235
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,583
You know, to offer
a different perspective on darkness.

236
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,583
It's kind of a passion project.

237
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,833
<i>Dark has existed
for over five hundred million years,</i>

238
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:59,375
<i>since early life on Earth
developed light-sensitive proteins.</i>

239
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,791
So?

240
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,125
You didn't like it.

241
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,375
I'm just trying to offer up
some food for thought.

242
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,125
Everyone is against me.
It didn't get into Sundance.

243
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,666
And it's so much better
than half of the movies there.

244
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,625
It's such a boys' club.

245
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,041
I mean, it's good.
It's a little short, though,

246
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,041
for someone who's been around
for over five hundred million years.

247
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,583
But, you know, concise is good.

248
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,875
Listen, I didn't ask
to be a supernatural entity

249
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,083
that evokes dread and despair.

250
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,416
I'm just a regular guy

251
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,458
trying to do my job.

252
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,208
But people always pick on me.

253
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,666
Truth is, almost everyone is scared of me.

254
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,375
Or hates me.

255
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,541
Or thinks I'm evil.

256
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,208
Some people think I'm nothing.
Hurts a guy.

257
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,458
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

258
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,083
No, it's okay.

259
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,291
You know, and I-I like people.
That's the thing.

260
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,175
It's just that so much
of how you see yourself

261
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,791
is through the eyes of others,
you know?

262
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,125
I just wish people would give me a chance.

263
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:11,083
I know how you feel.
A lot of kids at school pick on me, too.

264
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,916
Richie Panici, Davis Jensen,
Howard Helstrom,

265
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,916
Isaac Pill, Rebecca Warren.

266
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,875
She moved, but she still sends me
threatening letters on my birthday.

267
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,583
Which is sort of nice.

268
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,458
Huh. Yeah. Thoughtful.

269
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,958
I just wanna not be afraid anymore.

270
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,625
Yeah, that'd be nice.

271
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,750
Then maybe I wouldn't have
to hear you screaming every night.

272
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,708
Hmm...

273
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,833
Tell you what.
I think I've got a way to fix this.

274
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,708
You come watch me do my job for one night,

275
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,458
and you'll finally see
that I'm nothing to be afraid of.

276
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,666
You'll learn to appreciate
the beauty of the night,

277
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,000
instead of being
so terrified all the time.

278
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,583
So what do you say?

279
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:05,541
- Are you in, or are you in?
- I'm...

280
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,208
definitely not in.

281
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,458
Yeah, of course you're not. Well, fine.

282
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,875
If you wanna spend
the rest of your life paralyzed by fear,

283
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,708
be my guest, but that's on you.

284
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,416
- Wear pants much?
- Hey, Orion, catch!

285
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,458
Cryin' Orion! Cryin' Orion!

286
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,125
Hey, Orion.

287
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,708
I'm super excited for the field trip...

288
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,625
Okay, I'll go!

289
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,541
Mr. Dark?

290
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,208
I knew you'd come around!

291
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,916
Let's shake on it, you know?
Make it official.

292
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,333
See? Nothing to it.

293
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,041
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

294
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,375
I know what you're doing, Dad.

295
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,208
What do you mean?

296
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,666
By telling me this story.

297
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,208
- I'm not doing anything.
- Yes, you are.

298
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:18,291
You're telling me a story about
how you overcame your fear of the dark

299
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,000
to try and help me overcome
my fear of the dark.

300
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,750
Huh.

301
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,750
- Well, I...
- But it's not gonna work.

302
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,083
Fear of the dark
is an evolutionary adaptation

303
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,333
that people developed to protect
themselves from nocturnal predators.

304
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,291
Wow. You've done your research.

305
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,250
I wrote a poem about it.

306
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,208
"Hypatia the poet." I love that!

307
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,875
It's one poem, Dad.

308
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,500
I think that counts.

309
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,958
It's not very good.

310
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,875
I'm sure it is. Can I hear it?

311
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,250
No!

312
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,250
All I'm saying
is that fear of the dark is natural.

313
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,500
It's hardwired in us,
so there's nothing we can do about it.

314
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,750
Right. Well, in that case,

315
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,041
- I guess I'll just say goodnight and...
- Wait!

316
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,708
I'm not saying it's not a good story,
and I don't wanna hear it.

317
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,458
I'm just letting you know
that I know what you're doing,

318
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,291
and it's not going to work.

319
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,875
Okay, I got it.

320
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,958
So, you and Dark
were flying off into the night...

321
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,750
So, Dark and I
were flying off into the night...

322
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,291
Pretty great, right?

323
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,875
If by "pretty" and "great", you mean
"terrifying" and "awful", then yes!

324
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,083
I'm gonna get you to overcome
your fears if it kills me!

325
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:38,458
And I'm immortal, by the way,
so I've got all the time in the world.

326
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,583
I thought we'd start
with a little tour of what I like to call,

327
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,541
"the virtues of night."

328
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,083
See?

329
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:55,041
Without me, you wouldn't be able to see
all the wrinkles on the actors' faces.

330
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,166
So far, you're a terrible salesman.

331
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,250
Hm.

332
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:03,416
<i>♪ Are you too terrified
to try your best? ♪</i>

333
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,333
Hey? Pretty awesome, huh?

334
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,333
I'm allergic to fireflies.

335
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Not allergic to stars, though!

336
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,666
But I am allergic to dying!
We're way too high!

337
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,166
You're allergic to living.

338
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,208
- What?
- Uh, nothing!

339
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:25,583
<i>♪ Oh, it feels so real in my sleep ♪</i>

340
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,708
Go ahead. Put your hand in the water.

341
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,625
So a shark can bite it off?
Are you insane?

342
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:37,125
No, so you can see the beauty
of the ocean at night.

343
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,000
You are familiar with the concept
of "fun", are you not?

344
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,666
"Fun" is just a word people made up
to make danger sound more appealing!

345
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,458
Ah! Look at that!
You can't have fireworks without the dark!

346
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,916
Technically, you can set them off
at any time of day.

347
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,666
Yeah, I guess.
It'd be pretty lame, though.

348
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,291
Beauty is in the contrast.

349
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,166
Hey, are you closing your eyes?

350
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,458
I'm protecting my retinas!

351
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,041
- Oh, come on! Open them!
- No!

352
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,041
You're missing out on all the fun.

353
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,125
Absolutely not!

354
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,125
- Open your eyes!
- No way!

355
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,083
But that defeats the whole purpose!

356
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,166
- Not my purpose!
- It's for your own good.

357
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,291
You see how much better that is?

358
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,791
Kid? Kid? Kid!

359
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,416
Gotcha!

360
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,875
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- It was an accident.

361
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,250
You dropped me! I could have died!
I wanna go home!

362
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,833
Don't worry. I'm going to bring you home.

363
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:33,708
- Eventually.
- Eventually, when?

364
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,958
Hey, look! You can see the Big Dipper.

365
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,375
It's really quite beautiful
this time of year.

366
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:43,125
When are you bringing me home?

367
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,291
Great question. Very probing.

368
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,708
In 24 hours.

369
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,041
- So, anyway, back to the stars...
- 24 hours?

370
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,375
Yeah, well, that's how
the whole night and day thing works.

371
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,041
It's a 24-hour cycle.
I can't go backwards.

372
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,750
- What? Why not?
- Look, I better get moving.

373
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,875
But, hey, if you wanna walk home
in the middle of nowhere,

374
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:05,291
- in the dead of night, all by yourself...
- Wait, wait, wait!

375
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,291
I can't walk home by myself!
It's like 100 miles away!

376
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,000
All right then.

377
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,916
Looks like you've gotta come
with me after all.

378
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,166
Buckle up and hold on to your hat
because your mind is about to be blown.

379
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,916
Are you covering your eyes again?

380
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,666
- I plead the Fifth.
- Really?

381
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,583
Do you have any idea how many people
would love to be you right now?

382
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,083
- Zero?
- A lot!

383
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,875
The answer is a lot!

384
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,250
Because I'm the coolest Entity
of all time!

385
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,083
Because that's what you are
when there's no other Entity

386
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,041
that has ever existed
that people like better than you.

387
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,791
Good morning, everybody.

388
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,416
Right on time and so, so fine.

389
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,791
It's going to be 75 and sunny.

390
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:06,041
Low humidity and a cool breeze
coming out of the west.

391
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,833
Gonna be fun, fun, fun
in the sun, sun, sun.

392
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,208
But, let's be honest, when is it not?

393
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,875
God, I love this job.

394
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,125
Okay, so we got off
to a little bit of a shaky start

395
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,791
with the whole "dropping you
and almost killing you" thing.

396
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,791
But we can't dwell on that because
we've got a lot of work to do, kid.

397
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,625
And in a way,
my job is the most fundamental.

398
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,666
I show up every night, and I bring it.

399
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,875
- Bring what?
- Dark.

400
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,125
And it's probably
the most important job, too,

401
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,458
because without darkness,

402
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,375
the others don't get to do their bits.

403
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,000
What do you mean "the others"?

404
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,375
The other Night Entities.

405
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,083
Wait, there's more?

406
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,833
Raise. In or out, Insomnia?

407
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,684
I'm thinking. I'm always thinking.
You know that.

408
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:20,375
Can't seem to stop my brain.
Think, think, think!

409
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:24,875
Ah, crap. I'm out.
What about you, Quiet?

410
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,392
- Call.
- Call.

411
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,583
You're up, Sleep.

412
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,750
What?

413
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,416
Royal flush?

414
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,041
Unbelievable.

415
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,416
Gosh darn it!

416
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,583
Huh? What happened? What did I miss?

417
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,208
You won.

418
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:45,041
Oh, wonderful.
Pleasure doing business with you.

419
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,541
Great.

420
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,708
Wait, wait. Why are we going in here?

421
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,416
Well, kid, it's break time!

422
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,291
The other Night Entities and I
take one every new time zone.

423
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,708
We're fun, you're gonna love us.

424
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,666
- Heya, gang, what's up!
- Heya, Dark!

425
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,416
Welcome back! Huh?

426
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,375
Great work tonight, guys.

427
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,333
- You brought the kid?
- Dark brought the kid!

428
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,875
So irresponsible!

429
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,000
Unbelievable!

430
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,125
Are you nuts?

431
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,458
Well, this is the opposite of encouraging.

432
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,833
I've got this.

433
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:17,666
Orion, allow me to introduce you
to the other Night Entities.

434
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,416
There's Sleep, Quiet,
Insomnia, Unexplained Noises,

435
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,583
and, of course, the most creative
and poetic of us all,

436
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,166
- Sweet Dreams.
- Hm.

437
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,000
You brought the Screamer?

438
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:32,000
The kid who's afraid of everything!

439
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:35,500
Is this your latest attempt at trying to
convince the world that you're not so bad?

440
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,541
- Uh...
- Helping random children

441
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,250
to boost your fragile self-esteem

442
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,333
is not in our job description!

443
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:43,458
Whoa. That is insightfully harsh.

444
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,083
Do you have any idea
how many things could go wrong?

445
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,125
I mean, what if he freaks out
and slows you down,

446
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:51,208
and you know who finally catches up,
and you get obliterated,

447
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,500
and the concept
of darkness ceases to exist,

448
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:57,958
and the fabric of the universe
is permanently and irreparably altered?

449
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:00,916
- That's a thing that can happen?
- Ah, seems unlikely.

450
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
All right. Enough of this nonsense.

451
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:08,708
I'm sorry, honey,
but Dark never should've brought you here.

452
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:12,375
You're just gonna have
to find your own way home. Okay?

453
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:15,083
Now, come on, everyone.
Break time's over!

454
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:17,416
Some of us have work to do.

455
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,250
Wait!

456
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,208
One night could change everything!

457
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:29,291
I got 24 hours with this kid.

458
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:32,916
We help him overcome his fear of the dark
and all his nightly screaming,

459
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,750
and all that interference with your jobs
just goes away.

460
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,416
All right, fine.

461
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,083
Just make sure he stays out of my hair.

462
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:47,375
Absolutely. Not a problem.
Won't be in your hair at all.

463
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:16,291
- Did you mean that?
- What?

464
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,708
You really think you can fix everything
I'm afraid of in one night?

465
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:23,375
One night can change everything.

466
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,541
- Hey, what's that light?
- Light? What light? I don't see any light.

467
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:29,025
The one behind you that you're trying
to keep me from seeing.

468
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,625
Me? Keep you from seeing?

469
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,166
That's cuckoo banana talk.

470
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,458
Not so close.
I don't think they like me.

471
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:46,291
What? That's ridiculous.
You're totally likeable.

472
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:49,500
They called me night enemy number one
and said I ruin their jobs.

473
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:52,666
Yeah, admittedly, they didn't make
the best first impression.

474
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,916
But just wait
until you see them in action.

475
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,750
It's totally inspiring.
And not scary at all.

476
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:02,083
Ah, yes, sleep is responsible
for making sure

477
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,500
all the creatures of the world
go to sleep at night.

478
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,791
She's down there
making everyone go to sleep?

479
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,375
Oh, yeah!
You gotta watch, it's really fascinating.

480
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:18,000
- What?
- Oh, don't worry, she's a professional,

481
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,333
and it's a magic pillow.

482
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,083
<i>...and compare them to</i>

483
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:31,041
<i>our air fried quinoa.</i>

484
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,500
<i>I love quinoa. Yes!</i>

485
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:33,458
Oh, my God.

486
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,708
Please tell me that's magic chloroform.

487
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,750
Uh, yeah... Magic.

488
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:43,041
<i>...restless creatures walk more
than 3,000 miles in the seasons ahead.</i>

489
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,916
Oh, you're a cutie pie, aren't you?

490
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,875
Stop! No!

491
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:55,958
Stop!

492
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:58,666
Dark!

493
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,125
Do you mind? I can't have
this blabbermouth freaking out

494
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,791
while I'm trying to get work done!

495
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,583
None of what you're doing is okay!

496
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:07,750
Smothering someone with a pillow?
Chloroform? A hammer?

497
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,291
Not to mention,
questions of hygiene with that kiss.

498
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:13,291
Listen, I've been doing
this job for thousands of years.

499
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,750
I think I know what I'm doing, kid.

500
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,541
And these lips are clean!

501
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:21,791
Clean.

502
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:24,958
Uh, thanks for letting us see
how the sausage gets made!

503
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,666
I don't know
if I'll ever be able to sleep again.

504
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,000
Uh, right.

505
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:34,708
Well, if you're staying up all night
then I've got just the Entity for you.

506
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:40,250
Insomnia is the best impressionist
I've ever met.

507
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:43,041
He makes himself sound like
the person he's keeping up,

508
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:46,250
and then whispers worrisome things
in their ears.

509
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,166
Why is that even a job?

510
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,291
Oh, you're just great
at making friends, aren't you?

511
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:54,291
- Not really.
- Yeah, that tracks.

512
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:55,416
Now, watch

513
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,791
and learn.

514
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,500
Classic Insomnia.

515
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:05,833
Why did I say that to Michelle?
She's gonna think I'm an idiot.

516
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,416
Well, I'm pretty sure I'm getting fired.

517
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,541
Huh?

518
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,291
I'm never going to meet my deadline!

519
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,416
She's sleeping pretty soundly.

520
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,166
I'm gonna have to pull out
the big guns for this one.

521
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:26,153
<i>Who can tell me the capital of Delaware?</i>

522
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,208
<i>The capital of Delaware is D.</i>

523
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:34,041
<i>- Who can tell me the capital of Delaware?
- The capital of Delaware is D.</i>

524
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:36,375
All those sleepless nights
were because of him?

525
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:37,333
What a jerk...

526
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:40,041
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You think I'm the one doing that to you?

527
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:44,750
Nuh-uh, pally. I'm just a megaphone
for the thoughts people already got.

528
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,791
Don't follow me around
with this kid anymore, Dark. Okay?

529
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,833
He's very judgy.

530
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,875
I'm not judgy... Am I?

531
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:57,166
And we're walking.

532
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:05,708
Of course, none of us could do our jobs
without a little help from Quiet.

533
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,750
Ah! It's too quiet!

534
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,875
- Quiet... Quiet... Quiet...
- Enough with that dog!

535
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:49,541
We told you that this kid
would ruin everything, and he is!

536
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,434
- Uh-huh.
- I'm not some kinda glorified babysitter.

537
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,750
I need absolute concentration
to do my job,

538
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:56,309
and I can't have this kid getting
in the way and screwing everything up!

539
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,309
Now, get him out of here,
so I can get back to business...

540
00:30:58,333 --> 00:30:59,851
- Mm-hm.
- ...and focus on doing my job!

541
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:00,875
Okay, got it.

542
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,750
What'd she say?

543
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,625
Was it about me?

544
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,625
I'm gonna be honest.

545
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:11,250
I never have any idea what she's saying.
But she did look pretty angry.

546
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:13,916
Oh! Unexplained Noises.

547
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,458
Come on, this way.

548
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,083
Hey, hey, what's up?

549
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:23,708
I'm thinking this moment
calls for a crunching sound,

550
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:26,875
with the tiniest hint of scraping.

551
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,666
What was that?
Mommy, Daddy! I'm hearing noises!

552
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,750
Ah, yes. I'm really making an impact.

553
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,083
This is so messed up!

554
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:39,916
- Hey! It's okay, kid! It's not real...
- Can you not...

555
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,708
You're upsetting
the delicate balance of nature.

556
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:45,166
You may not understand it,

557
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,291
but we're doing very important jobs here!

558
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,875
I mean, in the kid's defense,

559
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:53,333
a lot of your job does involve
creeping around and scaring children.

560
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:56,625
I don't have to explain myself
to either of you.

561
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:57,583
The fact is,

562
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,708
his very presence
threatens to destroy

563
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:02,583
the fabric of the universe
as we know it!

564
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:08,000
Eh, don't let her get to you.
Her honk is a lot worse than her bite.

565
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,750
And, hey, I've saved the best for last.

566
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:13,541
So get ready, and hold on tight!

567
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,208
Ah, there she is.

568
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:20,875
You mean, all those colors?

569
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:23,333
Yep. That's Dreams doing her thing.

570
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:26,750
If seeing her work can't make you
appreciate the beauty of nighttime,

571
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:29,791
- then nothing can.
- What do you mean see her work?

572
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:47,833
Hey! Shh! Keep it down.
She's working her magic.

573
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:53,083
All right, what's churning
in your subconscious tonight, Irene?

574
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:57,500
Mm-hm. Okay. A lot of anxiety about work.

575
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:59,583
Big presentation tomorrow.

576
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:02,875
Hmm. Not sure you're ready
for this one, Irene.

577
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:05,458
Really need to impress your boss. Got it.

578
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:09,125
Oh, and your daughter found a rescue cat
that she wants you to adopt.

579
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,541
Mommy, can we keep him?

580
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:14,083
Good material tonight.

581
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:16,791
Now, let's work it all out.

582
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,708
You're confidently
giving your presentation.

583
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:24,166
If we just re-use the coil
from our winding mechanism,

584
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,708
we can reduce
our manufacturing costs by 30%.

585
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,916
Everyone's loving it.

586
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:38,958
Irene! Irene!

587
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,583
I think you've earned this, Irene.

588
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,166
World's most competent employee?

589
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,375
Mommy!

590
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:56,333
You're the best mommy ever!

591
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:59,083
That was one hell
of a presentation, Irene.

592
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,583
I definitely think
you're getting that promotion.

593
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,875
Oh, Mommy. Can we please keep him?

594
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,625
Yes, of course we can!

595
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:08,583
Whoo!

596
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:10,208
We love you, Irene!

597
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:14,000
Amazing, she's amazing.
You're amazed, right?

598
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:16,458
Yeah. She's pretty great.

599
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:17,541
I told you.

600
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:21,541
You know, this reminds me of a dream I had
where I was giving a class presentation.

601
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,505
But instead of cheering,
everyone was booing me.

602
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:27,541
And the weirdest part was, my classroom
was actually a dentist's office.

603
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:31,583
- Uh...
- Wha... Huh?

604
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:34,458
What the... I didn't conjure that.

605
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:37,541
- That's a coincidence, right?
- Definitely. It has to be.

606
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,958
Right. Because otherwise,
if I said something random,

607
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:42,041
like, I don't know, "evil cucumber"...

608
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,250
Wha...?

609
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:47,083
Hey there, Irene.
Time for your yearly check-up!

610
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,416
Uh...

611
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,708
What the heck is going on?

612
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,708
Dark?

613
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,041
No! Off-limits!

614
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,541
You promised to keep him out of my hair!

615
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:02,250
Look, I need to inspire him,

616
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,166
and your work's
the most inspirational stuff

617
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,083
- in the whole night time.
- Sorry about the cucumber.

618
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,000
Usually.

619
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:13,541
Stop! Don't say one more word.

620
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:16,583
Creating a dream is a very delicate art.

621
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,166
That means anything you say,

622
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,958
or even think, could influence the dream.

623
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:24,916
- Got it?
- Anything I think?

624
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,083
You thought of something scary,
didn't you?

625
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:30,500
What? What did you think of now?

626
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:32,125
Just a kid from my school.

627
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:35,625
Uh...

628
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:37,583
Who?

629
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,583
Richie Panici.

630
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,541
Run!

631
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,625
You've been "consificated".

632
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:59,750
The word is "confiscated"!

633
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:02,125
Cryin' Orion!

634
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:06,041
Cryin' Orion! Cryin' Orion!

635
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:13,708
Ever had a swirly before, Orion?

636
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,875
I mean, he can't like get hurt
or anything, can he?

637
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:20,666
No, it's impossible
to get hurt in a dream.

638
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,500
- Oh, well, that's a relief.
- Unless, of course, he dies.

639
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,833
- Then he dies in real life.
- Wait, what?

640
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,708
Kid, you need to get out of here,

641
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:29,666
or it's going to end very, very badly!

642
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,416
I'm very aware of that!

643
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,041
Uh... Huh?

644
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:37,875
Come on, Orion!
Think of something to get us out of here!

645
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,708
Come on! Think, think, think!

646
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:41,750
Wait! Page 14 of my sketchbook.

647
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,416
Clogging the toilet
and flooding the entire school.

648
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,000
Huh?

649
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,333
No!

650
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:11,666
Kid!

651
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,666
Hang on, Orion!

652
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:33,000
What the heck was that?

653
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:36,875
Kid, you're either extremely disturbed
or extremely creative.

654
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:39,083
You're extremely lucky.

655
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,125
That could've been a disaster.

656
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:50,416
But it wasn't a complete disaster.
You know why?

657
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,916
Because you looked your fears in the eye
and showed them what's what!

658
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:57,500
Okay, let's try that again.

659
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:00,916
You know what you do,
you just put your hand like this and we...

660
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,708
Is it me, or am I more excited
about this than you are?

661
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:07,791
I didn't overcome anything.

662
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:10,791
Kid, I was there.
I saw it with my own two eyes.

663
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:14,125
What you saw was me
being terrified and trying not to die.

664
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,458
Now that you mention it,

665
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:18,625
it did kind of have
an air of mortal desperation.

666
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:20,958
But that doesn't make it
any less impressive!

667
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:23,041
Dark, you're not listening.

668
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:26,208
I didn't overcome my fears.
I'm still just as scared as ever.

669
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:29,666
I know for a fact you're wrong,
and I can prove it.

670
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,916
- I sincerely doubt that.
- Oh, yeah, Mr. Smarty Pants?

671
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,333
Try this one on for size.

672
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:38,125
You're not still afraid of me.

673
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:42,583
Are you?

674
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:46,666
I'm not scared of you.

675
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,000
See?

676
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,916
That's what I'm talking about.

677
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:59,875
You know, my daughter's gonna love
that we're becoming friends.

678
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:01,958
I knew you'd start warming up to me.

679
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:04,375
Hold on, aren't you
too young to have a daughter?

680
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:05,833
My future daughter.

681
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:08,166
You're wacko, kid.

682
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,125
<i>Wait.</i>

683
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:12,958
So, are you saying that you could see
into the future when you were a kid?

684
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:16,458
I guess. I don't know.
I'm just kind of riffing here.

685
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:19,708
- Is that a bad idea?
- No. I don't know.

686
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,125
The story is great.

687
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:23,416
I like that you made
Light a character, too.

688
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,375
Is he coming back,
or was that just like a guest appearance?

689
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:30,375
Uh, possibly.
Like I said, I'm just riffing.

690
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:33,375
I don't know how you keep making
all this stuff up.

691
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,833
Well, you could definitely
make up a story like this.

692
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:39,375
No, I couldn't.
It's just... Is it too much stuff?

693
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:42,833
Like you're already traveling around
the world with magical Night Entities,

694
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:45,208
and now you can predict the future, too?

695
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,250
Gilding the lily?

696
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:48,875
I don't know what that means.

697
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:52,083
- It means what you said.
- Oh. Then, yeah.

698
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:54,375
Hm. That's a terrific point.

699
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:57,458
I'm going to remove
the "predicting the future" element.

700
00:39:57,541 --> 00:40:00,166
No more predictions from me
as young Orion.

701
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,875
You sure?
I mean, it's kind of cool and funny, so...

702
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:05,208
Nope! It's gone.

703
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:06,125
Okay.

704
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:08,166
Hm. I'm lost. Where were we?

705
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,291
You were flying through the night
with Dark again.

706
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:13,833
Right. So Dark and I were
flying through the night again,

707
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:16,375
only this time, it was different.

709
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:21,875

every wrinkle on the actors' faces!

711
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:26,333

Know what it looks like to me?

720
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:58,250
A robot waiting for a hug.

Is that a gas smell?

727
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,958
Did I remember to turn the oven off?

728
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:22,583
Nothing is working!

729
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:25,791
Okay, let's see. Which tape to use?
Which tape here...

730
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:27,958
- Hello!
- What did I tell you, kid?

731
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:29,726
What if life is a cosmic accident...

732
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,990
- What! No, no, no.
- ...and my existence has no meaning?

733
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:34,833
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no!
- Mommy!

734
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,416
That's it.

735
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,833
- I gotta get back into therapy.

Oh, sweetie, what's wrong?

754
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,541
I got scared.

755
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:26,208
I hate the dark so much.

756
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:42,791
Come on, everyone.

757
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:45,583
I hear the tea is exceptional here.

758
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:13,041
Hey, Dark. Thanks by the way.

759
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:14,666
For what?

760
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,750
You know, all of this.

761
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:20,333
Showing me that there's more to night
than just the darkness.

762
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:23,708
Ah, don't mention it.

763
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,291
That kid back there?

764
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,208
Don't listen to him.

765
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:32,083
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

766
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,375
- Maybe he does.
- He doesn't.

767
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:37,375
I was the same way, remember?

768
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,083
He's just afraid.

769
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:44,375
Yeah.
I know what it's like to be afraid, too.

770
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:48,458
You? What could you possibly be afraid of?

771
00:44:48,541 --> 00:44:51,375
I guess I'm afraid
that everyone's right about me.

772
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:56,875
That I'm not a good guy,
and I'm just as scary as everyone says.

773
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:02,750
Hey, Dark? Remember when you told me
you're actually a really great guy?

774
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,625
And I didn't believe you?

775
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:06,250
Yeah.

776
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:08,208
I'm starting to believe you.

777
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,500
Aw, thanks.

778
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:14,791
You know, you really have come a long way.

779
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:19,541
Uh, I don't know about that.

780
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:21,750
Hm.

781
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:23,993
That's it. Let's get back to work.

782
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:27,750
- Time to go.
- Okay. Time to get sleepy.

783
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:31,541
Welp, come on.
That's our cue. Break's over.

784
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:44,166
Orion, you dropped this.

785
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,500
Oh, uh, thanks, Quiet.

786
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:50,791
Eh... don't mention it.

787
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,208
All right, kid, you ready? Hop on. Huh?

788
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,875
You gotta be kidding me.

789
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:05,000
- Who is he?
- That is Light. He's Dark's nemesis.

790
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:05,958
Huh.

791
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:09,083
I like him, for some reason.
He makes me feel safe.

792
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,333
Like I'm wrapped in a warm blanket.

793
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:16,666
You know,
if you're into that kind of thing.

794
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,083
"Ooh, look at me. I'm so bright!"

795
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,791
I've got tricks too, you know.

796
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:25,166
But unlike some of us, I like to leave
a little to the imagination,

797
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,375
instead of rubbing it in everyone's face.

798
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:28,625
Come on, Dark.

799
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,958
Do we really have to
go through this every time?

800
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,250
Go through what?
I don't know what you're talking about.

801
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:37,250
Uh, your attitude,
your lateness, your insecurity.

802
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:38,666
How you doing, kid?

803
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,208
Um, hi!

804
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:42,583
It's always the same routine
with you, man.

805
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,416
I show up, you feel inadequate,

806
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,083
then you start to project
your insecurities onto me.

807
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:49,541
Every day, I bring brightness
and hope to the world,

808
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:52,000
and you bring the exact opposite.

809
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:53,833
Eh... That's not... I'm...

810
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:56,166
I do more than that.

811
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,291
Wait, really? Like what?

812
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:02,416
Like, a lot of stuff.
I would love to tell you all about it,

813
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,416
but I don't really have
the time right now.

814
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,666
Finally, something we can both agree on.

815
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,958
Welp, I'm bringing daylight through here
in about three seconds,

816
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:14,083
so if you want to continue to exist,
I'd, uh, you know...

817
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:18,125
Oh, whatever.
We were leaving anyway. Jerk!

818
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:20,916
I wouldn't call him a jerk.
He seems okay.

819
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,375
He's not so great. Trust me.

820
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,625
<i>Hey, Dad?</i>

821
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:27,041
What, you ready for bed?

822
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:28,708
Actually, no.

823
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:31,875
I was wondering if we could go for
a little walk while you finish the story.

824
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:32,958
Oh, really?

825
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:36,250
So, like, we could be in the night,
like Orion and Dark.

826
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,708
Um... Yeah, sure.

827
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:40,916
I guess it's not a school night.

828
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,916
So, yeah, let's go.

829
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:53,416
Um, come on. We can cut through the park.

830
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:55,416
Okay.

831
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:11,208
You know what?

832
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:14,791
- I think I like the other way better.
- Agreed.

833
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:27,291
Can I have my hand for a minute?

834
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,958
- Oh, of course. Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

835
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:32,958
I just thought of a couple new lines
and didn't want to lose them.

836
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:34,333
Oh, good ones?

837
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:38,625
Well, you know, just about how weird it is
that you can't see any stars.

838
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,250
Yeah. I couldn't agree more.

839
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:45,583
You don't have to pretend, you know?

840
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:48,541
That you wanted to come this way, too.

841
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,750
I'm not pretending.

842
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:53,125
The street lights were out in the park.
It was scary for me, too.

843
00:48:53,208 --> 00:48:55,500
But I thought you got over that.

844
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:57,375
That's what you said
in the story, at least.

845
00:48:57,458 --> 00:49:00,375
Well, it's a complicated story.

846
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:03,458
Then couldn't you let it be complicated?

847
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,791
Parents love simple stories like that

848
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:07,750
because whatever problem
the character has,

849
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:11,125
it all gets fixed, and then they don't
have to worry about it anymore.

850
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:13,250
Orion meets Dark. Dark's not so bad.

851
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:16,458
Orion isn't afraid of him anymore,
then there's a dance party.

852
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:19,208
You think I should add
a dance party?

853
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:23,750
I think if you're still scared,
you should let Orion still be scared.

854
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:26,875
The only stories
that really help are the true ones.

855
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,875
That is a really great point.

856
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:30,958
You think so?

857
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,500
I do.
And we should definitely use that idea.

858
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:04,791
What's wrong?

859
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:07,541
Yeah, did you die?

860
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:09,125
- Insomnia!
- What?

861
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:12,000
Jumping to worst case scenarios
is my actual job.

862
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:13,166
No. I'm good.

863
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:16,291
- Yeah. He's over that now, right?
- Totally.

864
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:17,625
Phew.

865
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:20,500
Good. All right now, let's get to work.

866
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:22,500
Race you inside.

867
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,833
Come on.

868
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:32,166
Uh, you all go ahead.
I'm more mortal than you are.

869
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,125
And, I mean,
there's not even a night light.

870
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:35,958
Trip hazard. No thank you.

871
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:37,708
What are you so scared of?

872
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:40,875
Nothing. I just...
I really like the daytime.

873
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:44,250
Like, the noises.
I mean, have you heard day noises?

874
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,666
- Birds, children playing, brunch?
- It sounds amazing.

875
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:50,583
It is, and you are definitely missing out.
Like, in the daytime,

876
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:53,166
there's this sense of connection
between the sounds and colors.

877
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,125
Everything is lit up in the daytime.
It's almost psychedelic.

878
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:58,291
Reds, greens, yellows, violet.

879
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:00,791
We have colors at night.

880
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:06,125
I mean, you can see them better
if there's a fire.

881
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:12,875
Hm?

882
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:15,708
Yeah, that's light!

883
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:18,333
- Oh, wow! Really?
- Incredible.

884
00:51:18,416 --> 00:51:23,416
- This makes me feel so safe and warm.
- I can see why this makes you less afraid.

885
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,041
I'm not saying I need it.

886
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,833
I'm just saying there's no way
to imagine how beautiful it is,

887
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:30,000
if you haven't experienced it.

888
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:31,166
Huh?

889
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,708
So you're saying the problem is Dark?

890
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,958
Well, in a way, yeah!

891
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:40,333
And I love him,
but I guess he's the issue here, right?

892
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:42,875
Don't get me wrong,
Dark's a really nice guy.

893
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:45,583
The best.
But as long as you're with him,

894
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:49,375
you can never really enjoy
all the amazing things Light has to...

895
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:50,458
What?

896
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:52,083
Uh...

897
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:57,625
Uh...

898
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,958
Well... time to go.

899
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:11,041
Sure you don't want to
wait for your new best friend?

900
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:22,208
Hey, Dark, you know,
I think you're the best.

901
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:24,791
See, I didn't get that
from the conversation

902
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,916
- back at the house with the door.
- No, no, I was just chatting.

903
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,240
Just because I'm talking
about how much I love ice cream,

904
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:31,958
doesn't mean I don't love French fries.

905
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:33,250
- Which one am I?
- What?

906
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:35,458
Ice cream or French fries?

907
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:36,833
Um, French fries?

908
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:38,500
And Light is ice cream?

909
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:40,666
- Exactly!
- Which one do you love more?

910
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,750
Is that really important?

911
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,000
Exactly!

912
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:49,041
I'm just saying, I wish you could all
experience daylight. You, too!

913
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,708
That's saying you wish everyone could

914
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:52,875
experience me not being around.

915
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:54,708
That's not what I meant to say.
Perfect!

916
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:57,750
Then you won't mind
unsaying it to the rest of the team,

917
00:52:57,833 --> 00:52:59,833
in a touching, heartfelt speech.

918
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:06,833
Hello!

919
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:08,916
Come on.

920
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:12,500
It has been brought to my attention

921
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:14,791
that some of my comments
during our last break

922
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:17,791
have been interpreted
in a way I never intended.

923
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:19,083
So let me be clear.

924
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:22,083
I love the nighttime
and my good friend, Dark.

925
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:24,500
Now, some of you might feel

926
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:27,125
you are missing out
on other experiences in the world.

927
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:30,166
But I'd like to take a moment
to remind you of the old adage,

928
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,875
"The grass is always greener
on the other side of the..."

929
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:36,875
World! Because it's daytime there,
and you can see that it's green!

930
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:38,958
Wait. Wait.
That's not what I was trying to say.

931
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:42,208
But it's true! I mean, what does
green grass even look like?

932
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:44,666
Yeah! Why should
the Day Entities get all the colors?

933
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:45,583
- Yeah!
- Exactly! See?

934
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:47,500
- That's what I think, too.
- Okay, everyone.

935
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:49,875
I think we're getting
a little off-track here.

936
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:53,333
Dark is great.
He has so many wonderful characteristics.

937
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:54,750
Like what?

938
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,791
Look... my point is that I was wrong.

939
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:04,166
Implying that Day is superior
to Night was wrong. Period.

940
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,708
Sure, some people might say

941
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:08,958
that you're not as pretty and vibrant
as Day, but so what?

942
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:12,625
Because, ultimately, the thing
that makes the vibrancy of Day exist

943
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,958
is its exact opposite, dark and empty.

944
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:18,250
So, you see,
if you think about it that way,

945
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:20,625
you are the wind beneath Day's wings.

946
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:23,125
I don't think this is helping.

947
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:28,208
Wait, let me finish.
So, in conclusion, thank you.

948
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:31,333
Thank you for performing
these humble, thankless tasks,

949
00:54:31,416 --> 00:54:34,375
in order to make
Light-filled Day great again.

950
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:40,916
- Well, that's it. I'm leaving.
- What? You're leaving?

951
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,125
Actually, I'm staying.

952
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:46,000
I'm staying and waiting for daylight.
Maybe I'll be able to get a job there.

953
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,875
Oh, come on. Be reasonable.

954
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:50,750
You! Don't even talk to me, you.

955
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:55,583
You're the reason everyone hates us.
It's you and your infernal Dark.

956
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:58,083
- But I'm your friend.
- Some friend!

957
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:01,375
Keeping me from the true beauty of life.

958
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:05,166
Come on, Unexplained Noises, we all know
you're not actually going to quit.

959
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:07,916
My name is Debby now. Call me Debby.

960
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:10,583
Debby!

961
00:55:13,416 --> 00:55:15,500
Well, that's just great.

962
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:18,583
But at least we've got
the rest of you. Right?

963
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:20,833
Come on, guys, let's hit the road.

964
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:28,500
I think what Debby means is that we could
all use a little light in our lives.

965
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:29,875
We all need to feel seen and...

966
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:33,125
Well, since no one else will,
I'm just going to come out and say it.

967
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,375
We all need to feel seen and heard.

968
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:37,434
- Yeah! That's what I've been saying.
- Yeah, we do!

969
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:39,916
- Exactly!
- That's it. I quit!

970
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:45,541
I'm quitting, too.
I'm sick of living in your shadow.

971
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:46,958
Wait, what?

972
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:51,333
Daydreams are a thing, right?
I bet that'll be a fun new challenge.

973
00:55:51,416 --> 00:55:53,333
Definitely better than nightmares.

974
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:54,666
Dreams, please...

975
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,166
Well, that does it.
If Dreams is quitting then so am I.

976
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,958
I'm not sticking around
in the nighttime for dreamless sleep.

977
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:02,375
What's the point?

978
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:04,916
Well, if Sleep leaves, then, what...

979
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,875
it's my job to keep everyone awake
all the time?

980
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:09,750
No, no. That's too much work.

981
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:11,500
I quit, too.

982
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:16,166
Okay, break time's over, guys.

983
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,250
Stop messing around.
We need to keep moving.

984
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:25,916
Can't wait to see the dawn of a new day.

985
00:56:26,708 --> 00:56:30,375
Guys, don't make me
do this by myself, please.

986
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:31,791
We all need to work together.

987
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:32,875
We're...

988
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:34,541
we're friends.

989
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:41,625
Well, I really enjoyed spending
all that time with you all.

990
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:45,083
Have a good morning.

991
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:17,208
Good morning, everybody!

992
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:20,125
Did someone say, "Light"?

993
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:31,208
Honestly, I don't know
what anyone sees in him.

994
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,916
That makes one of us.

995
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,541
There's nothing left of the night but me.

996
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
This isn't night anymore.

997
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:48,791
It looks like nothing now.

998
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:50,958
It sounds like nothing.

999
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:53,666
And tomorrow, even you're gone.

1000
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,166
So I just fly around by myself forever?

1001
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:02,541
- This was a terrible idea.
- I'm really sorry.

1002
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:04,958
Maybe tomorrow,
I can find them during the day,

1003
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:07,416
- and I can try to convince them that...
- No!

1004
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,291
I'm not going on.

1005
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:15,291
I'm going to sit on this...
whatever it is.

1006
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:17,791
Rock? I don't know.
I don't think it's alive.

1007
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:20,916
I'm gonna sit right here
on this thing and wait for daylight.

1008
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,333
- No, you can't!
- Why not?

1009
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,708
Nobody likes me anyway.

1010
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:27,541
- That's not true.
- So where did everyone go?

1011
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,041
Hey, Dark!

1012
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:38,250
Let's go! Move it or lose it.

1013
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:41,291
Uh, Dark?

1014
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:44,250
Come on! Let's go.

1015
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:46,625
Dark, come on, you can't be in the light.

1016
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:49,000
You can't be where you're not.
You'll disappear.

1017
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:51,958
I'm willing to risk that possibility.

1018
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:52,916
Okay.

1019
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,416
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1020
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,166
- Wait, don't!
- I'm really sorry, kid.

1021
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,791
But day waits for no one.

1022
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:04,208
Dark, you have to leave now!

1023
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:09,250
Oh, I didn't get that right at all.

1024
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:10,833
What are the odds?

1025
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:13,333
No! Dark!

1026
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:17,375
Dark!

1027
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:33,541
Bummer. I-I tried to warn him.

1028
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:38,458
Well, I have to go make
life on Earth possible and stuff, so...

1029
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:39,833
see you, kid.

1030
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:43,375
Good morning, everyone!

1031
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:47,458
I hope your days are
as bright and beautiful as your faces.

1032
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:54,375
Yeah, but then what?

1033
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:56,500
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

1034
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:59,083
I don't know what's next.
That's all I got.

1035
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:02,416
You're just leaving little you
all by himself in the middle of...

1036
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,500
Where are you?

1037
01:00:03,583 --> 01:00:05,958
Europe somewhere? I-I don't know.

1038
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:07,625
That's not a good ending.

1039
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:10,208
Yeah. I've said
it was a complicated story.

1040
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:12,125
I guess I just ran out of ideas.

1041
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,291
It's your story. It happened to you!

1042
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:17,833
True. But I don't know how it ends.

1043
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,375
<i>These visible patterns
amongst the stars</i>

1044
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:31,791
<i>came to be known as constellations.</i>

1045
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:34,375
<i>Looking over various
ancient depictions</i>

1046
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:36,083
<i>of the night sky,</i>

1047
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:39,083
<i>- we start to recognize...</i>
- We're looking at a ceiling.

1048
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:42,875
It's a really good illusion, though.
And highly educational.

1049
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:46,125
We should be able
to look at the real sky at night.

1050
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:49,875
They build a city
that blocks out the stars,

1051
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:52,125
then they put up fake stars to look at?

1052
01:00:53,041 --> 01:00:57,416
That's... That's a really profound
thought, sweetie.

1053
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,666
Thanks.
I didn't mean to put down your job.

1054
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:03,458
I really think the planetarium is cool.
Really cool.

1055
01:01:03,541 --> 01:01:05,416
It's a cool place to work.

1056
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:10,375
Thanks. I like it,
and I like what you said. Both things.

1057
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:18,250
Maybe I have an idea
about where the story could go.

1058
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:19,958
Oh, yeah? Well, let's hear it.

1059
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:21,625
Really? Are you sure?

1060
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:24,125
I'm very sure. Go on.

1061
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:26,708
Okay. So, I show up.

1062
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:28,291
- You?
- Do you not like it?

1063
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:30,458
No, I love it. Keep going.

1064
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:33,791
I always wondered if we would be friends
if we were the same age.

1065
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:36,541
I can't wait to find out.
Please, continue.

1066
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:39,958
Okay. So, I show up.

1067
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:45,208
Hello.

1068
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:49,958
Uh, hello, person appearing on my turtle.

1069
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:52,125
I'm Hypatia.

1070
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,958
The ancient Greek astronomer?

1071
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:57,416
Well, I'm not her.
Named after her, though.

1072
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,375
I guess that makes more sense. I'm Orion.

1073
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:02,000
The constellation.

1074
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:06,083
Yes, which, to me, looks less
like a hunter and more like a...

1075
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:09,541
like a robot waiting for a hug.

1076
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:12,708
Yeah. I've heard that.

1077
01:02:13,541 --> 01:02:15,250
Do you know where we are?

1078
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:18,041
Europe somewhere? I don't know.

1079
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:20,625
Oh, man. I'm so far from home.

1080
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:22,750
I ruined a lot of things last night.

1081
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:25,458
I know. I've been following your story.

1082
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:26,666
- Really?
- Yeah.

1083
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,476
Without night,
people won't be able to sleep.

1084
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,875
And without sleep,
everyone's gonna go crazy.

1085
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:33,375
- We can't let this happen!
- That's why I'm here.

1086
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,875
I think I have an idea about how to get
all the Night Entities back.

1087
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:39,166
Really? What's your idea?

1088
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,708
I have a poem I wrote to try to help.

1089
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:49,541
<i>"Now that it's gone, I miss the night</i>

1090
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:51,916
<i>Now that the only thing left is light"</i>

1091
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:58,041
I don't know.
I don't think this will help.

1092
01:02:58,125 --> 01:02:59,750
Keep going.

1093
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,708
<i>"And something else
Neither night nor day</i>

1094
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:07,833
<i>Maybe everyone cheers, 'Hooray'</i>

1095
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:12,458
<i>But I miss the night
Because it's like me</i>

1096
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:16,750
<i>And when it is dark is when I best see</i>

1097
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:20,333
<i>Maybe the world has become too bright"</i>

1098
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:25,125
<i>"Too loud, too selfish,
and ready to fight"</i>

1099
01:03:27,416 --> 01:03:29,226
<i>Possible apocalyptic event,</i>

1100
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,916
<i>which is creating a climate emergency,</i>

1101
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,958
<i>with catastrophic consequences
in the absence of darkness.</i>

1102
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:41,166
Huh. It's not quite how I imagined it.

1103
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,791
<i>"And the one
That is quiet never gets heard</i>

1104
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:48,750
<i>And the ones that are awkward
Dismissed as mere nerds"</i>

1105
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:49,708
Huh.

1106
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:51,250
Okay.

1107
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:56,333
I gotta admit, this is starting
to undermine my confidence a little.

1108
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,208
<i>"I once thought quiet
The absence of sound</i>

1109
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:04,833
<i>But learned it's the space
Where small sounds can be found</i>

1110
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:08,166
<i>I once thought Dark
Was the absence of Light</i>

1111
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:13,291
<i>But it is the place
Where starlight is bright</i>

1112
01:04:13,375 --> 01:04:16,541
<i>The Quiet, the Dark
The Dreams once embraced me</i>

1113
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:19,666
<i>They let me feel safe
In a world that erased me</i>

1114
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:22,958
<i>Now that it's gone, I miss the night</i>

1115
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:26,250
<i>Now that the only thing left is light"</i>

1116
01:04:27,958 --> 01:04:29,750
You're a poet.

1117
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:32,750
Yeah, I am.

1118
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:36,166
It was beautiful. Thank you.

1119
01:04:37,416 --> 01:04:40,708
We need to bring the night
back to the world.

1120
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:44,083
But Dark is... He's gone.
We can't make night without him.

1121
01:04:44,166 --> 01:04:45,375
But he's not.

1122
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:47,708
Dark is still very much alive,

1123
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,041
in your memory.

1124
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:51,625
But the only one
who can access your memories is...

1125
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:53,708
Dreams. We need your help, Dreams.

1126
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:55,083
We need all of you.

1127
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:56,666
The whole team.

1128
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:59,309
Remember, if you die in the dream,
you die in real life.

1129
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:02,291
- Insomnia!
- What? I'm doing my job!

1130
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:07,375
Uh...

1131
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:10,750
On second thought, maybe it's not such
a good idea to put the fate of the world

1132
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:12,625
in the hands of an 11-year-old kid

1133
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:14,500
with severe performance anxiety.

1134
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:15,583
Don't worry.

1135
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:17,458
I'll be right there with you.

1136
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,166
I'm on it.

1137
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:35,541
Okay, Sleep. You're up.

1138
01:05:35,625 --> 01:05:38,500
Do not worry. I've got this.

1139
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:40,708
All right. Time to put you to...

1140
01:05:41,666 --> 01:05:43,041
sheep!

1141
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,208
Great job, Sleep.

1142
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:54,583
You ready?

1143
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:57,666
Sweet dreams, Orion.

1144
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:10,708
We're gonna have to go deep.
Into the darkest recesses of his mind.

1145
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:16,916
<i>Talking to Sally.</i>

1146
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,291
<i>Speaking in class.</i>

1147
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:23,208
<i>Murder clowns.</i>

1148
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:29,375
<i>Cell phone waves... Mosquito
bites...</i>

1149
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:32,000
<i>Falling off a skyscraper.</i>

1150
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:34,916
<i>Oh, yes. Here it is.</i>

1151
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:38,375
<i>It's the night you first met Dark.</i>

1152
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:43,333
You're in your bedroom...

1153
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:46,458
you hear a low rumbling
from the room's darkest corner.

1154
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:50,625
You see an ominous form taking shape...

1155
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:52,166
as if being drawn out of

1156
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:53,875
the very darkness of the room.

1157
01:06:57,416 --> 01:07:00,208
- Dark!
- Orion!

1158
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:04,291
- You came back for me.
- Of course I did. You're my friend.

1159
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:06,458
I was afraid I lost you.

1160
01:07:06,541 --> 01:07:09,166
Nope. I'm right here, bud.

1161
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:13,833
Huh?

1162
01:07:15,916 --> 01:07:17,166
- Whoa!
- Dark!

1163
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:19,041
Oh, no!

1164
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:35,458
Dark!

1165
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:39,333
Orion!

1166
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:19,625
What is that?

1167
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:21,250
Why does it keep showing up?

1168
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:25,666
This is in your head, Orion!
You're the only one who can stop it!

1169
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:28,000
You have to go in there and pull him out!

1170
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:30,458
I can't just jump in there!
What's gonna happen?

1171
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:34,750
I have no idea,
but I think that's the point!

1172
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:36,833
Wh... What are you talking about?

1173
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:38,416
We always want to know the ending

1174
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,875
because it makes things less scary
in the middle parts.

1175
01:08:40,958 --> 01:08:44,333
But maybe being scared
is just a part of life.

1176
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:47,083
I think you just need to feel the fear.

1177
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:49,875
And do it anyway.

1178
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:58,083
Good luck, Orion.

1179
01:08:58,166 --> 01:09:00,083
Thank you, Hypatia.

1180
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:13,041
Hang on, Dark. I'm coming!

1181
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:16,416
Orion! Over here!

1182
01:09:16,916 --> 01:09:18,208
Orion!

1183
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:24,208
Dark!

1184
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:30,083
Now let's get you out of here.

1185
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:42,333
It's not gonna hold!

1186
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:44,375
Oh, no. Just hang on.

1187
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:56,416
We need to wake him up now!

1188
01:09:57,125 --> 01:09:59,791
If we don't do something,
they're both going to...

1189
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,000
Get torn into
a million tiny pieces and die?

1190
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,958
Move over. I've got this.

1191
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:11,625
It's going to suck us in!

1192
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,666
What happens now?

1193
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:16,750
I don't know.
But being with you, somehow,

1194
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:20,208
it makes the horror of the unknown
less horrible.

1195
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:22,166
I know what you mean.

1196
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:26,458
- It's been a pleasure knowing you, Orion.
- The pleasure is all mine.

1197
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:43,125
Orion!

1198
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:44,875
Time to wake up!
You're late for school!

1199
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:47,625
You read an article
about how sleep stunts your growth!

1200
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:48,916
Come on, wake up!

1201
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,291
- Why isn't it working?
- I don't know, man!

1202
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:53,625
I've never put that many Z's
on anyone before!

1203
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:56,958
Wake up, wake up! Time to wake up!

1204
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,333
Wake up!

1205
01:11:00,416 --> 01:11:02,541
- Wake up already!
- Come on, wake up!

1206
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:22,125
Orion, if you don't wake up
you're going to miss your field trip.

1207
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:24,208
<i>You're going to miss your field trip.</i>

1208
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:28,708
Sally!

1209
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,750
Dark. We made it.

1210
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:13,041
That's some nice work, kid.

1211
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:41,458
All right! There it is.
Glad to have you back, old buddy.

1212
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:17,333
Bye, Orion. It's been a dream
spending the night with you.

1213
01:13:17,416 --> 01:13:20,291
- It really has.
- See you, Hypatia.

1214
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:22,000
I admire your work.

1215
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:24,000
And I admire yours.

1216
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:27,166
And I admire yours, too.

1217
01:13:29,208 --> 01:13:31,416
Oh... Wow.

1218
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:35,333
You're the best, Dark.

1219
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,083
Yeah, I second that.

1220
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:42,291
- Thanks for everything, Dark.
- Hear, hear.

1221
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:56,125
- So, this is it.
- But I'll see you tomorrow night.

1222
01:13:56,666 --> 01:14:00,791
Ah, sure. You'll see dark.
I mean, I won't look exactly like this.

1223
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,291
But you'll see me in new ways.

1224
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:05,791
Ways that are even better.

1225
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:08,166
Yeah. I can see that now,

1226
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,916
and I can appreciate it.

1227
01:14:11,083 --> 01:14:12,291
Thanks for that.

1228
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:16,208
No. Thank you, Orion.

1229
01:14:16,291 --> 01:14:19,125
- For what?
- Well, seeing me the way you do.

1230
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:23,791
So much of how you see yourself
is through the eyes of others. You know?

1231
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,916
So, you gonna go
on that field trip tomorrow?

1232
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Yep.

1233
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:32,250
- You nervous?
- Terrified.

1234
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,166
But I'm going anyway.

1235
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:42,000
Ah, good for you, kid.
You're gonna be all right.

1236
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:45,375
Well, it was nice meeting you, Hypatia.

1237
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:47,458
It was nice meeting you, too, Dark.

1238
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:13,333
- You've got a good father there.
- I know.

1239
01:15:13,416 --> 01:15:14,500
Wait, what?

1240
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:28,125
- I don't understand.
- I came to help you get home.

1241
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:30,458
- From the future?
- Um, I guess so, yeah.

1242
01:15:30,541 --> 01:15:33,166
- Am I okay, in the future?
- Yeah, you're doing good.

1243
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:35,791
So, I don't have to worry so much,
is what you're saying?

1244
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:37,416
I guess that's what I'm saying.

1245
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:42,333
They look so young.

1246
01:15:42,416 --> 01:15:44,916
Really?
They look a million years old to me.

1247
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
What?

1248
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:53,041
Orion. I thought we agreed,
no check-ins tonight.

1249
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:56,333
We did, Dad. It's tomorrow night.
You and Mom slept through the entire day.

1250
01:15:56,416 --> 01:16:01,375
- What? Oh, my God, it's true.
- Really? Holy cow, we overslept!

1251
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:02,938
Yeah, I think you were tired.

1252
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,833
I-I wanted to let you sleep.
To give you a break.

1253
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:08,916
Who's that?

1254
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,875
Believe it or not,
that's my child...

1255
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,083
hood friend.

1256
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:15,875
- Oh! Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1257
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:17,791
- What's your name?
- Hypatia.

1258
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:18,791
That's pretty.

1259
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:22,500
So, I was wondering
if you could maybe drive Hypatia home.

1260
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:25,208
- Um, where do you live, sweetheart?
- Manhattan.

1261
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:28,541
Manhattan? How'd you get here?
Do your parents know you're here?

1262
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,083
- Uh, sort of.
- And they can't pick you up?

1263
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:35,041
- Um...
- Oh, yeah, right.

1264
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:36,583
Maybe we'll give them a call.

1265
01:16:39,458 --> 01:16:40,833
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

1266
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:43,636
We can't just drop you off in New York
20 years before you were born.

1267
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:44,666
Yes, I know.

1268
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:46,351
How did you get back here
in the first place?

1269
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:48,791
- I don't know. I just did it.
- Well, do it again.

1270
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:49,875
Okay.

1271
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:52,291
Mm...

1272
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:55,958
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. It's not working.

1273
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:58,416
This is terrible.
Maybe my parents can adopt you.

1274
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,416
- What? No! What about Mom?
- She seemed to like you in there.

1275
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:04,166
Not your mom. My mom. Your wife?

1276
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,500
Oh, yeah.

1277
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:07,083
I have a wife?

1278
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:09,791
- Yes, my mother!
- I know!

1279
01:17:10,416 --> 01:17:11,958
This is a disaster!

1280
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:14,083
Huh?

1281
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:22,791
Who are you?

1282
01:17:22,875 --> 01:17:25,000
I'm Tycho. I came to help.

1283
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:26,958
I have my time machine out on your lawn.

1284
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:28,708
I can take you home.

1285
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:31,125
- You can?
- But we have to go now.

1286
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:34,250
Coming back to get you has released
interdimensional time monsters,

1287
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:37,666
and we have to stop them
before they multiply and destroy history!

1288
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,875
See you in 20 years.

1289
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:45,833
See you in 20 years.

1290
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:53,833
When I say "now,"
make a beeline for the capsule.

1291
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:55,875
Got it!

1292
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:05,000
Now!

1293
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,041
Oh, yeah!

1294
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:24,333
Hold on to your butts!

1295
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:41,208
What the...

1296
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:45,500
Dad!

1297
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:46,583
Hypatia!

1298
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:06,125
Hi, Tycho. Long time no see.
You haven't changed a bit.

1299
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,166
You have. You're so old now.

1300
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:12,083
Well, I guess
I have grown up a little bit.

1301
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:14,208
Well, gotta go.

1302
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:15,833
Thank you for getting me home.

1303
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:16,916
No problem.

1304
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:28,916
And then I piloted the time machine module
all the way back here,

1305
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,708
killed the time monsters,
and climbed back in bed.

1306
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:35,333
- Huh. That's such a good ending.
- Yeah?

1307
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:39,750
Definitely. Thank you for figuring it out.
I was stuck.

1308
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:44,166
- You sleepy?
- Yeah.

1309
01:19:46,375 --> 01:19:49,041
- Goodnight, sweetie.
- Goodnight, Mom.

1310
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:55,458
Open or closed?

1311
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,583
Mm. Closed tonight.

1312
01:19:57,666 --> 01:20:00,083
Okay. Sleep tight.

1313
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:19,000
Hey, Dad.

1314
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:20,750
He asleep?

1315
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:23,916
- Almost.
- Did he come up with an ending?

1316
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:24,875
He did.

1317
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:27,333
Time machine.

1318
01:20:27,416 --> 01:20:31,666
Oh, that's good.
A time machine.

1319
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:33,291
That's a good idea.

1320
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:36,458
I thought so, too. You up for a while?

1321
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,458
I'm heading back to the city
in the morning,

1322
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:42,166
so I thought I would
just enjoy the night for a bit.

1323
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:45,250
Okay, Dad. I'm turning in.

1324
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:48,625
Goodnight, Hypatia.

1325
01:20:50,416 --> 01:20:51,833
Goodnight, Mom.

1326
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,125
Goodnight, Hypatia.

1327
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,916
Mind if I sit with you?

1328
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,416
I would love that.
