00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:12,207
<i>Friday before
Rosie left for school.</i>

8
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:18,947
<i>She was in the garage
getting her bike and...</i>

9
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,351
<i>Did she seem
different in any way?</i>

10
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:29,858
<i>Did she say anything to you,
Mr. Larsen, before she left?</i>

11
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:34,796
<i>I was on the phone
taking an order. She...</i>

12
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,534
<i>She just waved.</i>

13
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,411
<i>And that was the last time
you saw your daughter?</i>

14
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,579
<i>Anyone you can think of
that might have done this?</i>

00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,185
<i>Mrs. Larsen?</i>

16
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:02,590
<i>Her fingernails.</i>

17
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,929
<i>What-What was that?</i>

18
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,001
<i>Her fingernails.</i>

19
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:18,222
<i>They were broken.</i>

20
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:22,561
<i>Why?</i>

21
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,390
<i>Was your daughter
involved in politics?</i>

22
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:26,214
<i>No, no. She's-She's quiet.</i>

23
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:31,969
<i>She'd... stay at home most weekends.
Hangs out with her brothers and...</i>

24
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,756
sometimes her friend Sterling.

25
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,944
What about this
boyfriend, Jasper?

26
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,663
Lasted only a few
weeks. Rosie broke it off.

27
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:45,533
I think in the summer.

28
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,904
He ever hurt your
daughter, Mr. Larsen?

29
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:54,943
I should have got off the phone.

30
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:58,746
I should have said good-bye.

31
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,621
Well, these were
found on the body.

32
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,390
Keys, jewelry.

33
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:15,163
Coroner's got no cause of death yet.
You having a talk with the campaign?

34
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,312
Yeah, I'm about to call them.

35
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,384
No, you do it.

36
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:23,004
Political nature of this case,
deputy com's gonna be watching.

37
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,373
So you have to dot
your i's on this one.

38
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:28,410
I handed in my paperwork.
I don't work here anymore.

39
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,596
Paperwork's sitting
on my desk till I sign off.

40
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,399
- You found her, Sarah.
- And I have a wedding to plan.

41
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,567
Yeah, it's in what? Three weeks.

42
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,619
Give me 24 hours,
then you can go.

43
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:41,740
Sir, you know I
used to work point...

44
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,975
on Undercover busts
down at County, right?

45
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,744
Rick, hold on a second.

46
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,430
Oh, and, uh, car keys
were found in the ignition.

47
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:52,166
Could be somebody inside
the campaign. Keep me posted.

48
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,105
Did you get my message?
<i>Yeah. Uh, where's Jack?</i>

49
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:58,974
With Regi on the
boat. He's fine.

50
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,843
<i>Okay, good.</i> Oakes
is making me stay.

51
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:04,741
You're kidding me.
<i>Just till tomorrow.</i>

52
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:08,066
Rick, I'm so sorry.
This is crazy. <i>Okay.</i>

53
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:11,819
Well, cancel the
wedding. It's over.

54
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:15,957
<i>Might as well tell you. I'm
in love with another woman.</i>

55
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:18,209
<i>Strawberry blonde. Hot.</i>

56
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:23,181
She has the softest,
smoothest, "rubberiest" skin.

57
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,767
<i>And the best thing
about her? She's here.</i>

58
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:29,003
<i>Oh, and she's naked.</i>

59
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:32,256
Candy Cane's a lucky girl. <i>Yeah.</i>

60
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,459
Hey, get home to me soon.

61
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,212
I will. I love you. Bye.

62
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:46,654
I appreciate you keeping
this just to family for now.

63
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:49,004
The first 48 hours
are the most important.

64
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,477
When can we bring Rosie home?

65
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,765
Um, soon.

66
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,902
We'll have a unit over at your house
later to go through your daughter's room.

67
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,507
Why'd you want to know
if she was into politics?

68
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:07,336
We're looking at every angle.

69
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,378
You should get
home. Get some rest.

70
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:18,135
I'm sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Larsen, Mr. Larsen.

71
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,772
Will you find who did this?

72
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,008
We'll do our best.

73
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,579
Will you find who did this?

74
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,967
Yeah.

75
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:52,020
We took in close to 24K tonight.

76
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:55,423
The blue hairs of Seattle
were sufficiently charmed.

77
00:07:58,261 --> 00:07:59,928
You must be exhausted.

78
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:03,564
Nope.

79
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:06,412
Well, good, because I have
a nice pinot waiting for us.

80
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,141
Hello. Yes, this is she.

81
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:21,315
I don't... I don't understand.

82
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:29,357
Yes. We'll meet
you at the office.

83
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,630
That was the police.

84
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,078
That missing girl
from the high school...

85
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:42,170
They found her body, Darren,
in one of our campaign cars.

86
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:51,262
We'll need to know who
had access to your vehicles.

87
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,332
Absolutely. This is terrible.

88
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:58,152
I don't understand how our campaign
can have anything to do with this.

89
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:00,316
Where were you this weekend?

90
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,407
Uh, Tacoma, Friday night,

91
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,426
then back here in the city,
attending several campaign events.

92
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:08,913
I can get you a list. We were both
with the councilman around the clock.

93
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:12,016
Was Rosie Larsen connected
to the campaign in any way?

94
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:15,219
No. I've checked everything,
including our volunteer lists.

95
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,469
So Friday, you were campaigning
out of town, Councilman?

96
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:23,328
Uh, I was taking a much-needed
break. I can provide the number of the inn.

97
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,346
The owner will
confirm I was there.

98
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:28,666
And the owner was with you
around the clock too, huh?

99
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,603
Why don't you start looking
through those personnel records?

100
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,039
I'm sure it's a long list.

101
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,809
I put our staff files
on a flash drive.

102
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,245
I'll have to send the records
from the campaign office.

103
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,570
Is there anyone else who
can vouch for you Friday night?

104
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,240
I can. I was with
the councilman.

105
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:54,953
We'll need a statement
from both of you.

106
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:57,357
- Not until
we issue a press release.
- I'd rather not go public now.

107
00:09:57,381 --> 00:09:59,658
It's not up to you. We're in
the middle of a campaign.

108
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,100
Whoever did this hid her well.

109
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:05,519
Our only advantage is he
doesn't know we found her.

110
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,656
How much time do you need?

111
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:10,908
Till midnight at least.

112
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,846
I'll be in touch.

113
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,614
Councilman.

114
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:29,661
Oh, screw that. There is
no way we are sitting on this.

115
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:33,042
Darren, you're not seriously considering
it, are you? What do you recommend I do?

116
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,034
Call a press conference immediately
and express outrage at this tragedy.

117
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,813
You gotta go on the attack.

118
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,750
Adams has had his head so far
up Columbia Domain Fund's ass...

119
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:43,007
that crime has skyrocketed 12%.

120
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,756
In fact, if it wasn't for him, dead
girl would probably be alive today.

121
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,713
How do you do that
with a straight face?

122
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,426
We're a month away from the
election. This thing will sink us.

123
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,612
Not if we play it right.

124
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:56,404
Court the girl's family.
Speak at her memorial.

125
00:10:56,473 --> 00:10:58,172
And say what exactly?

126
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,087
That you know what they're going
through because you've been there yourself.

127
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:02,793
No.

128
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:09,266
We send out a press release by
noon. Your private investigator, Penato?

129
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,237
Have him start vetting our people, and find
out what the hell happened with that car.

130
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,210
Darren, he's right you know.

131
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,446
Try to look at this
as an opportunity to

132
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,882
tell the voters once
and for all about Lily.

133
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,050
I am not using my wife.

134
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,180
What are we going
to do about Yitanes?

135
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:30,543
She'll withdraw her
endorsement tonight if we

136
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:33,140
blindside her with this,
and you need the unions.

137
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,179
Set up a meeting for
noon. I'll tell her then.

138
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,050
A reporter from the<i>
Record</i> called yesterday.

139
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:48,005
He was tipped off about Yitanes.
Someone sent an e-mail from the office.

140
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,724
Who?

141
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,278
He wouldn't say.

142
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:58,416
I want you to check everyone's
accounts here at the campaign. Be discreet.

143
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:02,643
Yeah, I'll get Nathan
on that right away.

144
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:07,425
How old was she? The girl?

145
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,678
Uh, I don't know.

146
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:18,419
We're gonna take the later flight,
Jack. You can start school tomorrow.

147
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,848
No, I'll pick you
up in a few hours.

148
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:24,770
Yeah, you can go on the
water with Regi in the morning,

149
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:26,905
but don't forget to
wear your life vest.

150
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:29,163
Uh, I-I really... I really
appreciate the help.

151
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:31,265
You're welcome. Thanks a lot.

152
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:35,807
The campaign car was
reported stolen Saturday

153
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:37,871
morning by a couple
of campaign workers.

154
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,341
This is the police
report. Who drove it last?

155
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,611
Some female volunteer
last Wednesday.

156
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,613
It's been on the
lot till it got jacked.

157
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,922
What were the keys
doing in the ignition?

158
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:52,186
These dumb asses
keep them there.

159
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:56,457
Says it makes it easier for
their people to drive them off.

160
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,593
So where to next, boss?

161
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:04,365
Are you still mad about that,
what I said to the Larsens?

162
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:07,067
I mean, I can handle 'em.

163
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:11,038
You know, the guy probably punched
Rosie in the face before he grabbed her.

164
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:14,242
That's what they do to kids.
That's why the head wounds.

165
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,044
You want to tell that to
the parents, go ahead.

166
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,070
You want me to get
you something to eat?

167
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,972
No.

168
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:13,034
Jesus, how could this happen? How
could she be missing all weekend?

169
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,919
I just don't get it.

170
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:19,994
Hey.

171
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,400
I didn't tell the boys nothin'.

172
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,954
But Tommy's so scared,
you know? Asking questions.

173
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,155
I just don't know what
to say to him, Stan.

174
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:41,796
I could pick 'em up from school.

175
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:45,566
They should be here with you,
right? You want me to go get 'em?

176
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:51,389
We'll do it. We gotta keep
things normal for them.

177
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,811
Yeah.

178
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,066
You didn't sleep, babe.

179
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,037
You should get some sleep.

180
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:17,865
Yeah.

Oh, come on. Come on,
guys. You're killing me here.

Jonesy. Jonesy, you gotta be
in Greenwood for that pick-up.

I told you like two hours
ago, man. I know. I'm on it.

Stan. You hear
anything about Rosie?

Let's fold this up and get
out of here. Yeah, we're goin'.

190

Hey, we ain't paying
you to stand around.

Get outta here already.
You too. Both of you.

192
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,179
Got it. I heard you.

193
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:27,784
Cops called. They said me and
the guys gotta go to the station?

194
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:30,738
What's goin' on?

Stan?

196
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,624
Hey, what's your
problem, Sterling, huh?

197
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:54,294
Telling Rosie's dad she was
at my house? What the hell?

198
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:56,530
Then where is she? Get off...

199
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,766
Yeah, like I'd know.

200
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:01,469
I'm not sticking
it to her anymore.

201
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,273
Jasper!

202
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:09,844
What?

203
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:12,713
The police are here.

204
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,449
Rosie's missing. They
want to talk to you.

205
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:17,534
You too, Sterling. Come on.

206
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:28,729
I drove Rosie to the dance,
and we, like, hung out.

207
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,026
But then I couldn't
find her, so I left.

208
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,768
I thought... I mean, she
was gone all weekend,

209
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,604
so I thought maybe
she went to Jasper's.

210
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:38,383
She would do that, you know.

211
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:40,168
Go to his house.
She didn't go there.

212
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,672
I don't know where
she went. I'm sorry.

213
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,447
So Jasper, he
wasn't at the dance?

214
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:48,744
I already told you he
wasn't. I'm not lying.

215
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:52,019
I didn't say you were lying.
We have a video of the dance.

216
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:54,989
It's a yearbook thing. I can
get that for you if that'll help.

217
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:07,034
Hey, it's not your fault,
Rosie disappearing.

218
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:12,205
I know.

219
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:14,892
<i>Picked up some
old lady Friday night.</i>

220
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:17,711
Some bar in Tukwila.

221
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,883
I think Lee Ann,
Anna Lee, that...

222
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:25,072
What, do you want to call her?

223
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,327
Hey, you can't do that.

224
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,279
What's the name of the bar?

225
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:44,255
The Blue Moon.

226
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,108
And what time did
you meet this woman?

227
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:53,914
Uh, 8:00, 9:00,
10:00. I don't know.

228
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:56,651
Look, she was on her
fourth Miller High Life.

229
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,669
Told her I had a
six-pack at home.

230
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,671
You know how to charm 'em.

231
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:05,610
Well, it doesn't take
much. Ones your age.

232
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,022
How long did you
and Rosie go out?

233
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:17,388
We didn't. Look, we hooked
up for like two seconds.

234
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,690
And then she got bored with you?

235
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:23,121
- What the hell's going on here?
- Mr. Ames. Your secretary said
you weren't available.

236
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:24,845
This is over. Now.

237
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,959
Your son's not under arrest.
I was just talking to him.

238
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:30,368
You want to talk to him?
You contact my attorney.

239
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,453
Uh, my phone.

240
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:40,727
She insisted on
speaking with Jasper.

241
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:42,956
I want to be alone with my son.

242
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:53,474
Dad, I can explain...

243
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,447
What did you do this time?

244
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:08,505
<i>- Come on. We're rolling.
- Look scary. ♪♪</i>

245
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,140
<i>Come on, Rosie.</i>

246
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,743
So nobody I.D.'d the
campaign car at the school.

247
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,180
- Doesn't mean it wasn't there.
- I don't know.

248
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,982
I'm feeling the
boyfriend for the perp.

249
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,345
What's Jasper doing
driving Richmond's car?

250
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:22,853
That kid's a douche.

251
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,569
Sorry, little man. I don't care.

252
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:30,595
Well, I do. Got anything
in the school locker?

253
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:34,298
Yeah. Books,
notebooks, algebra books.

254
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,867
- I hate algebra.
- Me too.

255
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:40,104
Yeah? So, like, check this.

256
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:46,043
A biker goes blah-blah
distance at eight miles per hour...

257
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:50,647
and then the same fool, he
bikes back at 10 miles per hour.

258
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,117
So what's the average
round-trip rate?

259
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,702
I don't know.

260
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,771
And I don't give a shit. Holder.

261
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,543
Cell calls to home,
parents' phones, Sterling.

262
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:04,311
Not much of a social life.

263
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,229
Till that boyfriend.

264
00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:09,924
What was she doing with him?

265
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,670
Good girl with no secrets.

266
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,638
She lied to her mom
about her costume.

267
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,275
And her Fabrizio Bianchis.

268
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,148
There's no way she could afford
these. You're lookin' at two G's easy.

269
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,711
How do you even know
that? How do you not?

270
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:30,621
- Mom shops at Ross, that's why.
- Ohh!

271
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,891
Maybe you should go get
some chips or something.

272
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,896
Jasper could have bought
these. Tryin' to win her back.

273
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,566
No candy bars. Something
healthy like corn chips.

274
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:46,003
Yeah, Funyuns,
son. Get your fiber.

275
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,888
I mean, that could work out.

276
00:21:47,957 --> 00:21:50,123
Like raising your kid
on vending machines.

277
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:53,077
Ha, ha, ha.

278
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,263
Don't feel bad, Linden. I mean,
you-you really ain't that bad.

279
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:59,553
So little man and your
boyfriend, they get along?

280
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,297
My fiancé. Yep, they do.

281
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,354
That's good 'cause
my mom's boyfriends?

282
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,773
Whoo! They had it out for
me. They were like lions.

283
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:10,377
Like kill the cub to get the
female back in heat. It was like...

284
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:11,878
Jasper Ames.

285
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:14,698
Boyfriend. Arrested
back in April for auto theft.

286
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,950
Took a neighbor's
Maserati out for a joyride.

287
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:19,236
Guy never pressed charges.

288
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:22,807
Dad owns half of Mercer Island's
waterfront. It's not surprising.

289
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,203
- So how we doing with Richmond?
- Alibi checked out.

290
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:27,961
Staff records too. None of
'em got kid-tiddling records.

291
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,897
And Larsen's employees cleared.

292
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:32,682
So, that makes
Jasper our best bet.

293
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,434
Hmm.

294
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:40,374
You ready for the bad news?

295
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,160
Richmond's issuing a
press release in an hour.

296
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:53,154
Nathan checked all campaign
and office e-mails. Nothing.

297
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:54,889
Have him look again.

298
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,726
Any word on the investigation?

299
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,429
Penato said the cops
have been at the school

300
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:03,225
all morning. Looks like
they're focusing there.

301
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:05,210
Are they close to an
arrest? He couldn't tell.

302
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:08,313
He also checked our staff against
county criminal records and ViCAP.

303
00:23:08,337 --> 00:23:10,382
We're in the clear.
Oh, that's good news.

304
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:12,439
Oh, it gets better.

305
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:16,343
The campaign car? Reported
stolen Saturday morning.

306
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,424
Lot of thefts in that
lot the last two months.

307
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:21,732
- Crap security.
- Lucky for us.

308
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:24,517
So our connection to
this is purely coincidental.

309
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:26,815
Psst, psst, psst. What are
you all whispering about?

310
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,607
Ruth. I was wondering when
you'd make your grand entrance.

311
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:32,470
And I'm dying to know the big,
bad secret you're gonna tell me.

312
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:37,130
Can I get you anything? Uh, cinnamon
latte, double pump, soy. Make it fast.

313
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,866
Sure thing, Ruth.

314
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:40,614
I'm really looking
forward to this evening.

315
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,764
The unions have always
been important to me.

316
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:46,223
Then lose the suit. Longshoremen
and machinists don't take to Armani.

317
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,961
That's what I love about you.
You cut right through the bullshit.

318
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,963
So I will too. Hold on.

319
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,232
- Something's come up.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

320
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,551
If I could just steal
you for a moment.

321
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:06,009
You can't issue that press release.
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

322
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:09,813
Yes, you did. Now if you don't
mind, I'm in the middle of a meeting.

323
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,582
Hold off and I'll tell the press
how cooperative you were.

324
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:15,319
How you put this family's tragedy
ahead of your own campaign.

325
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:16,987
And if I don't?

326
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,156
You will be the candidate who
obstructed a child's murder investigation.

327
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,098
You have until midnight,
and then we go public.

328
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,233
Excuse me.

329
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,404
Darren... Holder? What is it?

330
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:38,726
What are you doing? At the
school? Okay. I'll be there.

331
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:42,262
You can contact
me at this number.

332
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:44,698
Detective Holder will take
over the case tomorrow.

333
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:46,449
Thank you for your help.

334
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,269
You didn't give me
much choice, did you?

335
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:53,189
And, Councilman, you might want
to call off your dog at the school.

336
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,443
He won't find anything.
How did you know about him?

337
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,329
I was guessing.

338
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,681
And I just confirmed it.

339
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:04,118
Thanks for your time.

340
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,271
What are you doing?

341
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:12,943
Call that reporter you
know, Max Michaud.

342
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,523
Tell him he has an
exclusive, but embargoed

343
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,082
until after Yitanes's
announcement tonight.

344
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:22,219
Candidate shows character
in face of crisis. Not bad.

345
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:24,366
We make the cop happy.
We control the story.

346
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,456
I'll meet him after the
announcement tonight.

347
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,725
What do we do about her?

348
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:34,081
Now this may come out in
the next few hours or days.

349
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,082
I just wanted to
keep you in the loop.

350
00:25:36,151 --> 00:25:38,168
I'm hoping it won't,
but you just never know.

351
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,615
Okay. For God sakes,
Darren, what is it?

352
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,056
I smoked pot in college.

353
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:47,393
It was stupid, I know,
but I inhaled, Ruth.

354
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,948
Are you stoned now? What?

355
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,084
No. Are you?

356
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,800
Just don't get caught with
some intern's face in your crotch.

357
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,702
You'll be the next mayor.

358
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,043
God.

359
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:07,014
That's all you
needed to tell me?

360
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,748
Scout's honor.

361
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,951
Dad! Why are you here with Mom?

362
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,686
What's wrong, Mom?

363
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,188
Come here, baby. Let's
get that hat on you. It's cold.

364
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,658
- Let's go home, boys.
- But I want to fly my kite.

365
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:37,255
Not now, baby. Maybe
a little bit later, okay?

366
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,923
Yeah? <i>Hey, it's Belko.</i>

367
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:41,966
<i>There's a bunch of cops here.
Said they had to look at Rosie's room.</i>

368
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,712
<i>Maybe the boys
shouldn't see this, right?</i>

369
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:46,714
Yeah, let me know when
they're done. <i>You got it.</i>

370
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,806
You did so good.

371
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,375
Cops are at the house.

372
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,681
Hey, we got a little time.
Let's go fly that kite, huh?

373
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,050
All right!

374
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,119
Come on, baby. Let's go.

375
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,226
Come on, Tommy.

376
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:20,854
What do ya got?

377
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:23,757
I got a fish filet and
a veggie burger but...

378
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:26,071
What did you call me
down here for, Holder?

379
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:27,844
Okay.

380
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,813
Detective. Here you go.

381
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,083
Found it in a Dumpster.

382
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:36,853
Rosie's wig. From the dance.

383
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:48,799
I'm Detective Linden. This is
my partner, Detective Holder.

384
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:52,352
Can I get a show of hands if
you saw Rosie at the dance.

385
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,510
Rosie was wearing a
witch costume, pink wig.

386
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,765
Maybe one of you
saw her after the dance,

387
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:07,484
on her way home
or getting into a car.

388
00:28:10,872 --> 00:28:12,956
None of you saw her?

389
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,427
Should I bring in
the next group?

390
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:19,763
Yeah.

391
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:31,541
You let me know, Mrs. Parsons, if
that disability check doesn't show up.

392
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,843
I know you've been
waiting over a month for it.

393
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,946
I will, Mr. Richmond. You
know you've got my vote.

394
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,917
Thank you. Take care
of yourself now, all right?

395
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:43,887
Thank you, Mr. Richmond. Thanks.

396
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:47,440
You know, Yitanes is going
to eat you alive if she finds out.

397
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:51,512
Jamie, she will already have publicly
given me her endorsement. No going back.

398
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,848
Unless she finds out before
tonight. Plenty of time to tell her.

399
00:28:57,219 --> 00:29:00,921
She looks frail, Mrs.
Parsons, but she's not.

400
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:05,291
Took care of her husband, Joe, for
a year after he lost his legs in Iraq.

401
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,711
Brought him out to the
back porch, bathed him.

402
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,430
Joe was a big guy. Wow.

403
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:14,767
Now she has to fight just
to get her disability check.

404
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:17,187
That's why we're here.

405
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,290
I'm done talking about Yitanes.

406
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,426
Vern.

407
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,763
- How are you?
- Doing fine, Councilman.

408
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:29,049
Oh, it's good to see
you. Good to see you too.

409
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:34,805
Okay, Belko. Call me when they're
done, all right? <i>Yep. Not a problem.</i>

410
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,365
Mom... where's Rosie?

411
00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:47,979
Denny.

412
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,903
Come on. Let's go over
to your mom and Tommy.

413
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:53,189
But I want to fly my kite.
I know, I know. Come on.

414
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:07,070
Hey, guys, uh, me and your ma...

415
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:11,775
we... we have something
to tell you about your sister.

416
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,777
What, Dad?

417
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:25,422
You remember when Nana was sick,
and we went to visit her in the hospital?

418
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,931
Grandma said she didn't like
the hospital 'cause it smelled bad.

419
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,277
Yeah.

420
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,282
And... And then one day...

421
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:39,586
she wasn't there anymore.

422
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:42,622
And we couldn't visit her.

423
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:47,560
You remember where
I told you she went?

424
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:51,881
You said Grandma went to heaven.

425
00:30:54,036 --> 00:30:56,319
That's...

426
00:30:56,388 --> 00:31:00,023
That's where Rosie
is now, in heaven.

427
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:03,910
When's she coming back? When you
go there, you don't come back, dummy!

428
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:05,712
I'm not a dummy!

429
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:07,914
She's not coming
back 'cause she's dead!

430
00:31:07,983 --> 00:31:09,666
Tommy, come here.

431
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:11,117
Come here.

432
00:31:11,186 --> 00:31:14,288
Let me go! Get off
of me! Get off of me!

433
00:31:14,356 --> 00:31:18,008
Tommy! Here, baby. Baby,
come here. Come here.

434
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,846
Shh.

435
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:33,073
We're gonna be ok...
We're gonna be okay.

436
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,690
Right, Son?

437
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,387
Thanks for meeting
me, Nathan. Yeah.

438
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:07,841
Gwen tells me you, uh, had
all the e-mail accounts checked.

439
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,844
Nothing was sent to the<i> Record</i>
yesterday. I checked twice.

440
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:17,017
How about Gwen? Jamie?
You check their accounts?

441
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:20,037
Um, I-I didn't, no.

442
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,474
Well, do it.

443
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:27,444
Then report back to me. Clear?

444
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,613
Yeah.

445
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,288
Ready? I gotta pick up Jack.

446
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:16,592
I think I'm gonna stay for
a while. Do some digging.

447
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,896
Into what? We got
nothing from those kids.

448
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:23,199
Yeah. Well, you know, it
ain't your case no more, so...

449
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,104
But, you know, don't
you worry, Linden.

450
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:32,142
I'll get a ride. Oh,
I won't. Good luck.

451
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,796
Yeah. And good
luck in, uh, San Diego.

452
00:33:36,865 --> 00:33:39,866
And tell the little
man I said, you know.

453
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,601
Yeah, definitely.

454
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,404
Oh, the cops didn't bother
to clean up after themselves.

455
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,574
And they broke that
vase that Ma gave you.

456
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,643
Let's go play in your
room, boys, come on.

457
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,114
Hey, he said to go play in the
room. You have to come too.

458
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,960
Come on. Let's go.
Yeah, well I'm older.

459
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,851
Stop arguing. Go.

460
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,854
Uh, Terry, I'll do that.
You need to go to work.

461
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:20,890
I'm not going, Mitch. Geez.

462
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:25,177
Here. Use some bleach.

463
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,312
Why didn't you call her?

464
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,736
I mean, all weekend.

465
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:04,383
Hey, look, it's the cute cop.

466
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:12,391
Oh, my God.

467
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:22,135
My God, are you smoking pot?

468
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:27,207
Oops. You caught me.

469
00:35:27,276 --> 00:35:30,476
Aren't you, like, a cop?

470
00:35:33,282 --> 00:35:34,948
Do you want a hit?

471
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,369
I'm off the clock. It's not
like I'm gonna arrest you.

472
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,538
Whatever.

473
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:42,706
Okay.

474
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,062
Go to it, little girl.

475
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,791
Do it again.

476
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,230
You didn't inhale.

477
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,468
Hold it.

478
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,203
Hold it.

479
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:18,190
Now let it go.

480
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,928
Let it go.

481
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:25,036
That's some crazy, sick
weed. I'm so stoned right now.

482
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,266
Yeah. Is that right?

483
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:29,302
Yeah, totally.

484
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,542
So are we gonna party?

485
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,546
Yeah.

486
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:45,151
What?

487
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:47,454
How old are you?

488
00:36:47,522 --> 00:36:49,322
Old enough.

489
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:54,828
Yeah, all right.

490
00:36:54,896 --> 00:36:57,163
Here, you keep
it. I gotta bounce.

491
00:36:57,231 --> 00:36:58,731
Wait.

492
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,733
There's no place to
party here, princess.

493
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,469
I know a place.

494
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:07,206
In the basement. The cage.

495
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,227
The cage?

496
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,497
Hey!

497
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,832
Hey, aren't we gonna party?

498
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:17,393
<i>See the world. Uh, I am just...</i>

499
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:21,197
If we stay through the weekend, I can
go to Nash's party. What's the big deal?

500
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:24,100
The big deal is you're supposed
to start school tomorrow.

501
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:25,968
And Rick is waiting for us.

502
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,054
For you, you mean.

503
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,691
What's going on with you, Jack?

504
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:34,727
Nothing.

505
00:38:34,796 --> 00:38:37,897
I know how hard
this move is for you.

506
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:40,032
How much you're
giving up. I get it.

507
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:43,519
But it's gonna be great.

508
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:45,821
I gotta go to the bathroom.

509
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,424
We leave for the
airport in five minutes.

510
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:52,028
Let's get there early so I
can score some duty-free cigs.

511
00:38:56,968 --> 00:39:00,019
- Jack okay?
- How'd you raise four of 'em?

512
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,171
Had a wife.

513
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,325
Maybe I need one
of those. What's that?

514
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:09,228
Uh, coroner's report
on the Larsen girl.

515
00:39:09,297 --> 00:39:10,942
Cause of death was drowning.

516
00:39:10,966 --> 00:39:13,466
T.O.D. anywhere from
Friday through to Monday.

517
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:16,669
Tough call 'cause of the water.
Ditto on whether or not she was raped.

518
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:24,143
Rosie was alive when
that car went in the water.

519
00:39:24,212 --> 00:39:28,464
And it takes, what, 10
minutes to fill a trunk that size?

520
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,501
Ripped off her own fingernails
trying to claw her way out.

521
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:37,890
I'm not staying.

522
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,077
Well, you better get goin' then.

523
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,246
I'll have one of the
guys drive you and Jack.

524
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:54,152
Hey, Jackie boy, how you
doin', huh? You wanna go?

525
00:39:54,176 --> 00:39:55,919
Ohh! Doo! Ohh! You had me.

526
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,298
<i>Request available C.S.U. unit,

We'll call in our E.T.A.

529
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,416
Load it up.

530
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:28,085

00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,594
<i>And now, back to the news desk.</i>

533
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,941
<i>With 25 days left

534
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:36,744

537

Mitch?

538
00:41:33,474 --> 00:41:34,941
Mitch?

539
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:48,354
Where's Mom?

540
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:52,158
I don't know. I'm
hungry. When's dinner?

541
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:04,136
<i>Yitanes is gonna try to do all the
talking, so you gotta drown her out, right?</i>

542
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:05,904
You got your bullet points?

543
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:08,707
S.E.I.U. is the heart of the
city. The machinists built it.

544
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:12,578
You are Seattle, the
real Seattle, et cetera.

545
00:42:12,646 --> 00:42:15,047
You're gonna do great.
Tonight is your night.

546
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,883
Yeah, I guess so.

547
00:42:18,987 --> 00:42:22,688
Hello. This is Darren
Richmond. Who is this?

548
00:42:25,193 --> 00:42:27,593
I have no comment.

549
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:30,662
Yes. Yes, I'm sure.

550
00:42:34,335 --> 00:42:36,969
That was a reporter...

551
00:42:37,038 --> 00:42:42,241
wanting confirmation that the Larsen
girl was found in our campaign car.

552
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,702
You missed your plane? Again?

553
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,073
What is this place?

554
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:03,880
It's where the real
Halloween party went down.
