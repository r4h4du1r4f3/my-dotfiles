1
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:01,276
No!

2
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,130
Yeah. Linden here.

3
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,961
Back behind the tape.
Yeah, you heard me.

4
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:50,335
Sarah. Sorry about this.
Lieutenant said you were on call, so...

5
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,815
Where's the body? Conveyor shed.

6
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,406
Homeless guy found
her a couple hours ago.

7
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,075
Jane Doe. No I.D., wallet.

8
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,611
Coroner's en route.
You're the first one here.

9
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,047
Gotta go up the stairs.

10
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,883
Follow the ramp.
You'll find her.

11
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:07,764
You want me to walk you
through? No, I'm good, thanks.

12
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,956
You're outta here, what,
Friday? Nope. Today.

13
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,865
Hey, hey!

14
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:46,267
♪ For she's a
jolly good fellow ♪

15
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:48,502
♪ For she's a
jolly good fellow ♪

16
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:51,806
♪ For she's a
jolly good fellow ♪

17
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,675
♪ Which nobody can deny ♪♪

18
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,848
Yeah!

19
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,268
All right! Give her...
Give her a glass.

20
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,728
Rick, are you still here?

21
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,832
Rick?

22
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,153
Rick?

23
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,968
Boo. I so had you.

24
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,393
Uh-uh. Charlie Brown with the
football. I think Lucy needs a spanking.

25
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,429
No! No!

26
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,599
I'm not even gonna ask.

27
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,872
Where's Jack? Dropped
him off at school.

28
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,673
Is he mad?

29
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,493
He's 13. It's his
job to hate us.

30
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:48,329
He'll come around.
Or I'll make him.

31
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:52,167
What does Candy Cane
feel about Sonoma?

32
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:55,403
Pop that damn thing
before Jack sees it.

33
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:57,538
Okay.

34
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,375
What time are the
movers coming? In an hour.

35
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:04,312
Regi called. Said she wanted to take Jack
for a spin on the boat before you leave.

36
00:06:04,381 --> 00:06:06,347
Maybe she can give
me away at the wedding.

37
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,049
What'll your parents
think about that?

38
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,398
Who cares? What about you?

39
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,872
You ready to do this? Do what?

40
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,901
Sell the condo. Quit your job.

41
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,930
Move your kid away
from his cool friends.

42
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,833
Marry me.

43
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,975
You know I'm not one for words.

44
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:38,212
It's a good thing. I
only need two of 'em.

45
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:41,482
Mmm. That's me.

46
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:44,085
Why can't you fly
down with us tonight?

47
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,272
Candy Cane wants
to play. Yeah? Okay.

48
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,048
Tickets on top of the
fridge. Flight's at 9:30.

49
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,595
- I do.
- What?

50
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,916
Want to marry you.

51
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:04,005
Tickets on the
fridge. Flight's at 9:30.

52
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,025
No, I'll have a few
hours before the airport.

53
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,779
It would be great to
take Jack on the water.

54
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,133
Bad door. Wh-What
are you doin' here?

55
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,169
Uh, who... Can I help you?

56
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,471
- Yeah. This is my office.
- Who are you?

57
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,174
I'm Holder from
County. Oh, you Linden?

58
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,725
<i>Sar, you there?</i>

59
00:07:57,794 --> 00:08:00,461
Yeah. I gotta go. I'll
see you tonight, Regi.

60
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,243
Yeah, I'm Linden. I thought
you'd be outta here by now.

61
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,311
If you need more time, I
can wait outside. It's okay.

62
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:07,903
No, no. Come on
in. I'm almost done.

63
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,506
Damn it. Okay, I got it.

64
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,686
Oh, that guy.

65
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,443
There you are.

66
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,330
So I hear you're moving to L.A.

67
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,187
San Francisco area.

68
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,590
Um, Oakland? Sonoma.

69
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:31,993
Sonoma. That's nice.

70
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:33,962
Yep.

71
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:37,332
Nice weather. Ocean. Beaches.

72
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,367
Hate that shit.

73
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:42,470
You must love this place then.

74
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,675
Ouch.

75
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,924
Crackhead thought
she was Picasso?

76
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,915
Crackhead's
six-year-old son drew it.

77
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:57,585
- He get iced too?
- No.

78
00:08:57,654 --> 00:08:59,887
So what happened to the kid?

79
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,852
You don't waste time
moving in, do you?

80
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,988
No. County cut
me loose early, so...

81
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,246
Well, you got a
tough act to follow.

82
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,948
You wrapped up here,
Sarah? Yep. All done.

83
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,202
Good. Got a call down at
Discovery Park. Check it out.

84
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:17,839
On my last day? My flight's
tonight. You're still on the city's dime.

85
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:21,287
You can hand it off end of
shift, 6:00. Go on, do your job.

86
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,811
Take him. Show him
how to work a scene.

87
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,302
I know how to work a scene.

88
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:31,720
Grab a box. We'll take my car.

89
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,428
All right. Over there.

90
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:48,185
They tapped me out of
the academy first year.

91
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,954
Boom. Straight to Undercover.

92
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,724
So I was working Vice, Narco.

93
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,327
I don't know, I guess Narco
kind of stuck to me, so...

94
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,497
You? U.C.?

95
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,565
I never would have guessed.

96
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,068
Whatever.

97
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,471
It's mostly like
street-level buys and busts.

98
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,808
You know, Joaquin shooting
Rahim. Blah, blah, blah.

99
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,155
You think Homicide's
gonna be any different?

100
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,096
Well, at least
you got a bad guy.

101
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:17,932
Yeah? Who's that?

102
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,054
Is that why you're
runnin' away, Linden?

103
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:42,256
'Cause you don't know no more?

104
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,511
Detective Linden.

105
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,733
Where's the body? Still looking.

106
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,819
Schoolkids on a field trip
this morning found this.

107
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,474
This park's like
tweaker central at nights.

108
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:19,194
Ho bags bringing
their tricks down.

109
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,662
- Could be some base head.
- Owner's not an addict.

110
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:23,864
At least not the kind
who hangs around here.

111
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,367
It's a wool sweater.
Looks recently cleaned.

112
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,220
- Brought it to
the coin wash. So what?
- You dry-clean wool.

113
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,251
Do you know any tweakers who
drop their wardrobe off at the cleaner's?

114
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,958
Anything else?

115
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,559
This.

116
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,679
A.T.M. card.

117
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:41,115
"Stanley Larsen."

118
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:44,719
Guy loses his wallet while
he's getting his knob polished.

119
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:49,357
Anyway, um, keep
looking. Search the field.

120
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:04,150
You find anything else,
mark it, don't move it.

121
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:06,974
And call in Sex Crimes.
This is theirs for now.

122
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:08,809
Yo, we got here first.

123
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:11,745
Yeah, and we don't
got a body. Not yet.

124
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,748
You want to follow it up, go
for it. You're my ride, Linden.

125
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,719
So I'll drop you off at the
station. I need to finish packing up.

126
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:20,788
I thought you were done.

127
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:24,144
Flight's not till 9:00, right?

128
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,211
I won't let you
miss it. Promise.

129
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,733
Let's have a talk with
this Stanley Larsen.

130
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,631
What's that stink?
We're here for the pickup.

131
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,033
I'm Stan Larsen. Yes. Come.

132
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:58,125
Place gives me the creeps. Hey,
Belko. He can hear you, Belko.

133
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,477
Osama don't give a
shit. Do you, Osama?

134
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,316
What'd I tell you?

135
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,320
See? Take. Take.

136
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,433
Great. Thanks for your help.

137
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,925
My name Feza, not Osama.

138
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:19,113
I'll bring your
paperwork by tomorrow.

139
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:21,382
Shut up, Stan.

140
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,687
Hey, babe. <i>Stan, you
need to get home right now.</i>

141
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,368
Okay. You know what?
That's gonna stay broken,

142
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:43,666
no matter how many times
you wave that roll of tape at it.

143
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,050
We can't afford a new
one. I'll get Belko to fix it.

144
00:13:46,109 --> 00:13:49,660
You know what? I am in no mood
for that "Belko will fix it" bullshit.

145
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:53,247
Oh, there we go. Good as new.

146
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:56,517
Don't even look at that
"on" button, Stanley Larsen.

147
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,587
I've still got the
touch,<i> ukochana.</i>

148
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,913
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

149
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,748
No! No! Huh? Huh?

150
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,783
You're all wet! Get off of me!

151
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:15,086
Oh, no! Oh, no!

152
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,521
No! No! No. No.

153
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,692
You are in such trouble! No.

154
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,739
You are useless.

155
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,868
You are useless.

156
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,737
Get off of me.

157
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:39,060
Ah! No. Shut up!

158
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,794
Come here.

159
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:44,698
I gotta go.

160
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,345
Okay. Bye.

161
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:49,081
Come here, come here, come here.
I want to talk to you about something.

162
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:50,904
Yeah?

163
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,639
You got to promise
me you won't blow.

164
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,442
I mean it. Tell me, baby.

165
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,095
Rosie said she'd
apply for colleges.

166
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,798
She just wants
to go out of state.

167
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:04,251
Baby, that is a good thing, come
on, that she finally wants to go.

168
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,288
Well, if it's what she wants.

169
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:09,923
Of course it is, Stan. I'm not
getting into this with you again.

170
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,610
Mitch, out of state.
Isn't she kind of young?

171
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:16,697
She's almost 18. You've gotta
let her grow up sometime, Papa.

172
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:21,285
I'll think about it.

173
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,121
Okay.

174
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,223
Stan, gotta move.

175
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:29,143
Okay, one more time.
Right here on the stairs.

176
00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:31,379
Stop being such a devil.

177
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:33,447
You ready? Yeah, let's do it.

178
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,234
Jamie.

179
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,736
Well, I'm just on my way.

180
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,774
Hey, Darren. Good
morning. Hey, how are you?

181
00:16:34,444 --> 00:16:35,943
Councilman Richmond.

182
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:38,857
<i>Times</i> poll just came in. Adams
closed our three-point lead.

183
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:40,448
Good morning to you too, James.

184
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:43,517
Election's in 26 days. We don't
have time to be jerking off here.

185
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,220
Wow. Not an image
I want in my head.

186
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:48,589
Where were you? I, uh, slept in.

187
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:51,592
You never sleep in. I did
this morning. I lost my watch.

188
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,194
Which you took?

189
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,696
No. It's mine. It looks
like yours, but it's mine.

190
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,809
What time do we leave
for the school, Jamie?

191
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,501
Ten till. I'll
gather the troops.

192
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,770
He's more nervous than I am.
And you're surprised by this?

193
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:06,840
What have we here?

194
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:10,010
Looks vaguely like a man's
timepiece. Wherever did you find it?

195
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,447
On my kitchen table.
What was it doing there?

196
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:17,234
With the recent mall
shootings, the press is

197
00:17:17,258 --> 00:17:18,730
gonna hammer Mayor
Adams on the gang issue.

198
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:20,900
- Give 'em ammo.
- He killed my midnight
hoops tourneys...

199
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:22,918
and after-school programs
four years in a row.

200
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,458
That's easy.

201
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,572
"Now we have kids stealing and
dealing we could have turned around."

202
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:28,157
You write that? Jamie did.

203
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:32,283
- That's not bad.
- Mall shooters? Recent
gang inductees. Somalis.

204
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,318
Adams was a fool to
ignore them last election.

205
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,186
He'll pay for it
this time around.

206
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,307
Sixty thou and growing. Registration
in Rainier Valley's through the roof.

207
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,575
You get them to
vote, we got a shot.

208
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,894
Forum today could
be our turning point.

209
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:47,848
I had an interesting chat with
Councilwoman Yitanes this morning.

210
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,918
- Ruth is talking to you?
- Not only that,
she's endorsing me.

211
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,603
What?

212
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,155
We go public tomorrow. Until
then, we keep it under wraps.

213
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:57,758
The only way we get the
unions is with her vote.

214
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,645
- Add that to the Somalis...
- The election's ours.

215
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,561
Hey. Seattle P.D. We're
lookin' for a Stanley Larsen.

216
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,465
He's not here. You his wife?

217
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,034
- Yeah.
- Do you know
where we can find him?

218
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,338
Uh, he's on a job. I don't know
where. What about last night?

219
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,017
Why are you asking about Stan?

220
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,087
Does your husband usually
go out at night, Mrs. Larsen,

221
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:35,746
and not tell you where? No. Stan's
always home with me and the kids.

222
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,349
Last night too? Yeah.

223
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,864
We got home late from a
camping trip, so he was here.

224
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,808
Have him call us
when he gets in.

225
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,526
Are you sure he
stayed in last night?

226
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,929
Yep, I'm sure. How?

227
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,066
How do you think?

228
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,671
We just wait for
this prick to call?

229
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,709
In situations like this, I like to ask
myself, "What would Jesus do?"

230
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,854
Don't know. I'll ask him.

231
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,564
Mrs. Larsen, do
you have a daughter?

232
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,960
Yeah. Why?

233
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,073
Did she go on that
camping trip too?

234
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,448
No. She stayed here for the
weekend. She stayed at a friend's house.

235
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,872
When did you talk to her last?

236
00:19:37,493 --> 00:19:39,359
Um, Friday,

237
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,428
right before we left town.

238
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:45,016
Why?

239
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:55,776
Did you see Rosie and Cameron?

240
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,217
All right. Settle down, guys.
We don't have a lot of time today.

241
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,687
You guys got your questions
ready for the candidates?

242
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:10,140
Yeah? Did anyone do their
reading? Anyone? Anyone?

243
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,109
- Sterling?
- What?

244
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:13,978
Your question or your
cell phone... your call.

245
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,765
I'm looking for Rosie Larsen.

246
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,954
Um, yeah, totally. Rosie
spent the weekend at my house.

247
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,582
Did she come to school with you?

248
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:29,577
Like, I have a zero
period, and I left early,

249
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,795
so maybe she slept in.

250
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,281
I don't know.
Sterling, are you okay?

251
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:37,517
Oh, sorry. It
happens all the time.

252
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:39,586
Here. Uh, thank you.

253
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,134
Look, the candidates will be
here in less than half an hour.

254
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,269
Can you make sure the
seniors are seated by then?

255
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:46,373
Yeah, no problem, Ms. Meyers.

256
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,979
Nice try.

257
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,949
What?

258
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:56,052
I told you. How about
telling me the truth?

259
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,412
Rosie had dinner
with me and the boys...

260
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,166
and then she went to that
Halloween dance at her school...

261
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,162
at, I don't know, around 6:00.

262
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,470
6:00? That's the last time
you saw your daughter?

263
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:16,340
- Yeah.
- You recall
what she was wearing?

264
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,642
You know, tight
jeans and a sweater.

265
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,812
She said only freshmen wore
costumes. What color sweater?

266
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,865
I don't know. Pink.

267
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,685
Why are you asking about
her sweater, her clothes?

268
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:30,474
Your daughter have a history
of running away, Mrs. Larsen?

269
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,457
Rosie?

270
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,160
No, never. That's crazy.

271
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:40,080
- You have words
with her, a fight?
- No.

272
00:21:40,148 --> 00:21:42,833
You weren't worried when you
didn't hear from her all weekend?

273
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,907
I told you, our phone
was out of range.

274
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:54,611
Christ, she's 17. It's not like
we left some little kid behind.

275
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,736
Hello.

276
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:03,838
Yeah.

277
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:07,891
I-I don't understand.

278
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,210
No, no, I heard you
the first time. I'm-I'm...

279
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,763
Yes.

280
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:33,717
Linden.

281
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,956
That was Rosie's school.

282
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:43,226
She wasn't with
Sterling this weekend.

283
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,980
Last anybody saw her
was on Friday, at the dance.

284
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:01,278
The press are falling all over
themselves. Those kids can't stay awake.

285
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,582
Adams knew I would come after him on
the gang thing, and he covered his bases.

286
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,745
Expect a countermove. It
doesn't take the shine off you.

287
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:09,614
So why tell me? Because
he's trying to shake you.

288
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,958
And obviously it's working.

289
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:14,108
What's really wrong?

290
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:16,894
Move in with me.

291
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:20,697
Avoiding my question.
And you're avoiding mine.

292
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,497
You can break hearts after
you get the single-female vote.

293
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:27,170
You are cold-blooded.

294
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,641
I know. That's my
job... taking care of you.

295
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,212
So take care of me. Move in.

296
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:39,517
Darren, I know where
you were this morning.

297
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:45,255
I wish you'd talk
to me about her.

298
00:23:49,378 --> 00:23:51,645
Councilman. The police are here.

299
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:59,153
You should be aware that the
school is a potential abduction site.

300
00:23:59,222 --> 00:24:02,056
We'll do our best to be
discreet with the media out there.

301
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:04,624
Surely this can
wait, Lieutenant.

302
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:08,293
We can hold off as long as
you feel it necessary, Mayor.

303
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:13,083
- Councilman?
- Can it wait... your investigation?

304
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,182
Missing kids are usually
killed in the first 72 hours,

305
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,341
so, no, it can't.

306
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:26,864
Well, then we'll have to cancel.
A missing child takes precedence.

307
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,868
Gwen, you can contact
my office to reschedule.

308
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,435
Is that it, Lieutenant?

309
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:36,439
I apologize for the inconvenience.
We'll keep you updated.

310
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,959
Let's go.

311
00:24:41,597 --> 00:24:43,514
Darren.

312
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,966
I'd wager you were quite
the high school athlete.

313
00:24:46,034 --> 00:24:48,402
I never cared much for games.

314
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:50,888
Councilwoman Yitanes does.

315
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:54,324
I wouldn't depend on
Ruth's word, if I were you.

316
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,748
Assembly's canceled.

317
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:04,951
Return to your classes. Everyone
check in with your homerooms, please.

318
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:23,720
Sterling isn't in class. I don't
know where she is. I'm sorry.

319
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,517
We'll need her home address.
Yeah, yeah. The office will have it.

320
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,775
You were chaperoning at
that Halloween dance, right?

321
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:30,895
- Yeah.
- Who was Rosie with?

322
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,729
Sterling, like always.

323
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,509
Did she leave with her too?

324
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,734
I didn't see. I
was busy trying...

325
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,502
- Do you recall
what she was wearing?
- Yeah. Yeah.

326
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,716
She was dressed up like a witch.

327
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,423
A witch?

328
00:25:43,492 --> 00:25:45,392
Hat, wand, pink wig.

329
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,746
Most of these girls use
Halloween to play stripper,

330
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,881
so she kind of stood out.

331
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,367
Rosie... she was a pretty
hot piece though, right?

332
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:56,537
Yeah, I wouldn't know. She's 17.

333
00:25:56,605 --> 00:25:58,472
Kind of my point.

334
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,792
Anyone hittin' that?

335
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:05,012
Yeah, I don't think
she had a boyfriend.

336
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,097
Ask Sterling.

337
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,617
Are we done here? Yeah.

338
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:14,191
Call if you think
of anything else.

339
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,848
Hmm.

340
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,062
Linden here. <i>Is this
Jack Linden's mother?</i>

00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:43,320
It started at the fire road
where we found the sweater.

432
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:46,479
Looks like she ran a zigzag

00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,385

she's not here.

435
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:06,599
Where's the map? The
dad's alibi checked out.

436
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:09,113
The park ranger logged
vehicle plates at the campsites.

- No, he didn't.

488

Mama.

495

Wrap it up. We're done.

Where the hell is my daughter?
She's not here. She's not here.

499
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,821
Rosie! She's not here.
You can't go up there!

500

<i>Uh, negative. At

Let's go, Linden!

507
00:38:04,216 --> 00:38:06,394
<i>Hey, babe. I'm thinking pizza.</i>

508
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:09,853
How about we grab a couple pies after
I pick you and Jack up from the airport?

509
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:12,288
That sounds great, Rick.

510
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:14,440
I had this sick idea
for Sunday's barbecue.

511
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:16,742
<i>Jack's going to be
bored out of his skull...</i>

512
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:19,145
- What's the holdup?
- Give me a minute!

513
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,647
<i>So I'm gonna get one of
those Bounce-A-Rama things...</i>

514
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,395
You said that 20 minutes ago!
<i>Throw him in there with other kids.</i>

515
00:38:24,419 --> 00:38:27,419
<i>Let them bounce the crap out of each
other while the "grown-ups" get wasted.</i>

516
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,324
<i>Come to think about it, I
might jump in there myself.</i>

517
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,659
<i>No judgments, right?</i>
Let's go. Let's go!

518
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:35,394
<i>You there, Sarah?</i>

519
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:39,565
<i>I think I'm losing
you, babe. Hello?</i>

520
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:42,668
<i>Hello!</i>

521
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:44,771
<i>Sarah?</i>

522
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:47,540
Where does the
fire road lead to?

523
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,459
To Puget Sound. Why?

524
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:53,408
<i>Sarah.</i> Rick, I gotta
go. I'll call you later.

525
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,796
They found her, Linden.

526
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,753
How far is the Sound from here?

527
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:03,156
Way on the other
side of the park, okay?

528
00:39:03,224 --> 00:39:05,408
The Larsen girl ran in
the opposite direction.

529
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,777
So where are they
going with fishing poles?

530
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,163
There's a lake
on the other side.

531
00:40:15,596 --> 00:40:17,663
<i>Hello?</i>

532
00:40:17,732 --> 00:40:21,467
Mitch. Mitch, Rosie
wasn't with him.

533
00:40:21,536 --> 00:40:24,470
Stop it! Mom!
What? Where is she?

534
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:27,957
I don't know. I'm at the park.

535
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:29,759
<i>Why?</i>

536
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:31,811
You said they found
her sweater here, right?

537
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,400
Mommy. I-I don't
know that that was hers.

538
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,965
Mom. What's wrong, Mom?

539
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,233
Tom, go watch
your videos. Go on.

540
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,102
Yes! Why does
he always get to...

541
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,838
Go. Now.

542
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:47,076
Stan, she wouldn't
be at that park.

543
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,479
<i>I don't know where
else to go, Mitch.</i>

544
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:53,483
Why are you there? I don't
understand. What is going on?

545
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:07,981
Can you open the trunk?

546
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,516
<i>Be advised. Forensics
team is on scene.</i>

547
00:41:15,257 --> 00:41:17,774
<i>What is it? What's
going on, Stan?</i>

548
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,162
Stan?

549
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,904
Stop! Stop now!

550
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,540
<i>Stan?</i>

551
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:37,844
What are you doing? I need
you to get back in your truck, sir.

552
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,496
<i>I need you to get back in
there and move your truck.</i>

553
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:41,631
Stan!

554
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,700
Wait, wait. Can I help you, sir?

555
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:46,202
<i>Stan, what's going
on?</i> Please, sir.

556
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,950
Move back. Hey.

557
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,129
Rosie!

558
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,565
Rosie!

559
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:17,500
Calm down. Step back.

560
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:20,353
<i>Rosie!</i>

561
00:42:20,422 --> 00:42:22,967
<i>Detective, we've
got the father here.</i>

562
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:24,690
Rosie!

563
00:42:27,162 --> 00:42:30,729
Calm down. Just
let me talk to her.

564
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:39,154
Just let me talk to her.

565
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,056
Okay, okay, okay.

566
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:45,961
You can't be here, Mr. Larsen.

567
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,798
Is it my daughter?

568
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:53,369
Is it my daughter?

569
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,541
I'm sorry. You can't be here.

570
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,278
Oh, my... No, no.

571
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,448
No, no! Rosie!

572
00:43:05,517 --> 00:43:07,283
Rosie!

573
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,985
Just move back to the truck.

574
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:16,275
<i>Rosie!</i>

575
00:43:18,412 --> 00:43:20,213
Stan!

576
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:23,766
Stan! Stan?

577
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,918
<i>That's my baby girl!</i>

578
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,955
Stan!

579
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:32,825
Stan!

580
00:43:32,894 --> 00:43:34,927
Stan!

581
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:51,611
I ran the plates.

582
00:43:52,747 --> 00:43:54,781
Car belongs to the
Richmond campaign.

583
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,432
Richmond?

584
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,152
City Councilman Richmond?

585
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,188
